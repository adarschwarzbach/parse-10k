    "This notebook is a proof of concept for an algorithim that takes as  input the symbol of a US exchange-listed company and retrieves the content of the first section:  \"Item 1. - Business\", from all of the company's available 10-K files in and returns a JSON file containing the elements in the following format: {\"year\": \"<ITEM-1-HTML-ELEMENT>\"}\n",
    "    \n",
    "This proof of creates that desired output for Tesla, using a hand created local file that contains the links to recent 10-K fillings for Tesla. To complete this script as desired would require a method that given a stock symbol can create a file of the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "File is named \"company_symbol\".txt, file contains lines of:\n",
    "\"year SEC_url_for_10k_for_year.htm\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of the limitations of the sec-api, the sec url's are the only imput that can be used to parse for item 1 (not local files downloaded with sec_edgar_downloader). This is why I have created a proof of concept not the full script. In my \"Scrapbook\" notebook, there is the begging of a method to query the htm links (using Lucene query syntax) which could potentially be expanded upon to validate the proof of concept.\n",

    "This script utilizes sec-api.io to do the parsing the 10-k for the HTML item 1. I have purchased a 1 - month startup license for the purpose of this project. "
