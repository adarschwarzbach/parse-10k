# parse-10k
This repository is a proof of concept (script.ipynb) to write a Python script that gets as an input a symbol of a US exchange-listed company and retrieves the content of the first section:  "Item 1. - Business", from all of the company's available 10-K files. It returns the results from each 10-k avaliable in a json file of format {2022: <HTML object representing item-1>,...}. The proof of concept script was written utilizing SEC-API. I used Beautiful Soup and Regex in earlier iterations.
