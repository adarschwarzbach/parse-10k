Our employees can report concerns to their supervisor or human resources partner, as well as an integrity line to report concerns anonymously and without fear of retaliation that is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

Competing products typically include internal combustion vehicles from more established automobile manufacturers&#59; however, many established and new automobile manufacturers have entered or have announced plans to enter the market for electric and other alternative fuel vehicles. Overall, we believe these announcements and vehicle introductions promote the development of the electric vehicle market by highlighting the attractiveness of electric vehicles relative to the internal combustion vehicle. Many major automobile manufacturers have electric vehicles available today in major markets including the U.S., China and Europe, and other current and prospective automobile manufacturers are also developing electric vehicles.

We provide a wide variety of products and services, ranging from initial agricultural inputs such as fuels, farm supplies, crop nutrients and crop protection products to agricultural outputs that include grains and oilseeds, processed grains and oilseeds, renewable fuels and food products. A portion of our operations are conducted through equity investments and joint ventures whose operating results are not fully consolidated with our results; rather, a proportionate share of the income or loss from those equity investments and joint ventures is included as a component of our net income using the equity method of accounting.

Our Energy segment derives its revenues through refining, wholesaling and retailing of petroleum products. Our Ag segment derives its revenues through origination and marketing of grain, including service activities conducted at export terminals; through wholesale agronomy sales of crop nutrient and crop protection products; from sales of soybean meal, soybean refined oil and soyflour products; through the production and marketing of renewable fuels; and through retail sales of petroleum and agronomy products, processed sunflowers, feed and farm supplies. Our Ag segment also records equity income from our grain export joint venture and other investments.

During fiscal 2021, our Occupational Safety &amp; Health Administration (\"OSHA\") incident rate was 2.8 incidents per 100 full-time workers, as compared to an average of 3.6 incidents per 100 full-time workers during the three previous years, a reduction of 22%, and our DOT crash rate was in the top 1% of all carriers in our industry segment for the entirety of fiscal 2021. Beginning in February 2020 and throughout the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, our Environmental Health and Safety team continuously monitored and assessed the evolving situation, while implementing safety precautions to protect the health and well-being of our employees, customers and communities, including the use of personal protective equipment, facility cleaning and sanitation protocols and remote work initiatives for employees whose roles could be conducted remotely.</span></div><div style=\"height:42.75pt;position:relative;width:100%\"><div style=\"bottom:0;position:absolute;width:100%\"><div style=\"text-align:center\"><span style=\"color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%\">8</span></div></div></div><hr style=\"page-break-after:always\"/><div style=\"min-height:42.75pt;width:100%\"><div><span style=\"color:#0000ff;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%;text-decoration:underline\"><a style=\"color:#0000ff;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%;text-decoration:underline\" href=\"#i749c5f659dec467780a22b91120662fc_7\">Table of Contents</a></span></div></div><div style=\"text-indent:36pt\"><span style=\"color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:400;line-height:115%\">Community Involvement</span><span style=\"color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:115%\">.

More recently, in late 2016, FERC released a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that, if it becomes a final rule, would further break down barriers preventing energy storage from fully participating in wholesale energy markets. Finally, in January 2017, FERC issued a statement supporting the use of energy storage as both electric transmission and as electric generation concurrently, thus enabling energy storage systems to provide greater value to the electric grid.</p> <p style=\"margin-top:13pt;margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:0%;font-weight:bold;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10pt;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;\">Solar Energy Systems</p> <p style=\"margin-top:4pt;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-left:5.24%;text-indent:0%;font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10pt;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;\">Government and Utility Programs and Incentives</p> <p style=\"margin-top:4pt;margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:5.24%;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10pt;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;\">U.S. federal, state and local governments have established various policies, incentives and financial mechanisms to reduce the cost of solar energy and to accelerate the adoption of solar energy.

A SREC represents the renewable energy associated with 1,000 kWhs of electricity produced from a solar energy system. When a solar energy system generates 1,000 kWhs of electricity, one SREC is issued by a government agency, which can then be sold separately from the energy produced to covered entities who surrender the SRECs to the state to prove compliance with the state&#8217;s renewable energy mandate.</p> <p style=\"margin-top:13pt;margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:0%;font-weight:bold;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10pt;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;\"><font style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Competition</font></p> <p style=\"margin-top:4pt;margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:0%;font-weight:bold;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10pt;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;\">Vehicles</p> <p style=\"margin-top:4pt;margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:5.24%;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10pt;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;\">The worldwide automotive market is highly competitive and we expect it will become even more competitive in the future as we introduce additional vehicles in a broader cross-section of the passenger and commercial vehicle market.</p> <p style=\"margin-top:9pt;margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:5.24%;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10pt;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;\">We believe that our vehicles compete in the market both based on their traditional segment classification as well as based on their propulsion technology.

The drive inverter also provides &#8220;regenerative braking&#8221; functionality, which captures energy from the wheels to charge the battery pack. Tesla has developed a family of drive inverter designs that are customized to our proprietary motor designs to most efficiently meet the demands of each of our vehicles.

Conventional all-wheel drive vehicles distribute power to the wheels from a single engine driving a complex mechanical transmission system. By contrast, Tesla&#8217;s dual motor powertrain digitally and independently controls torque to the front and rear wheels. The almost instantaneous response of the motors, combined with low centers of gravity, provides drivers with controlled performance and increased traction control.</p> <p style=\"Background-color:#FFFFFF;margin-top:13pt;margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:4.54%;font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;color:#000000;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10pt;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;\">Vehicle Control and Infotainment Software</p> <p style=\"Background-color:#FFFFFF;margin-top:4pt;margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:4.54%;color:#000000;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10pt;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;\">The performance and safety systems of our vehicles and their battery packs require sophisticated control software. There are numerous processors in our vehicles to control these functions, and we write custom firmware for many of these processors. The flow of electricity between the battery pack and the motor must be tightly controlled in order to deliver the performance and behavior expected in an automobile. For example, software algorithms enable the vehicle to mimic the &#8220;creep&#8221; feeling which drivers expect from an internal combustion engine vehicle without having to apply pressure on the accelerator. Similar algorithms control traction, vehicle stability and the sustained acceleration and regenerative braking of the vehicle. Software also is used extensively to monitor the charge state of each of the cells of the battery pack and to manage all of its safety systems. Drivers use the information and control systems in our vehicles to optimize performance, customize vehicle behavior, manage charging modes and times and control all infotainment functions.

The drive inverter also provides &#8220;regenerative braking&#8221; functionality, which captures energy from the wheels to charge the battery pack when needed. Tesla has developed a family of drive inverter designs that are customized to its proprietary motor designs to most efficiently meet the demands of each of our vehicles. The primary technological advantages to our designs include the ability to drive large amounts of current in a small physical package.</p> <p style=\"Background-color:#FFFFFF;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:9pt;text-indent:4.54%;color:#000000;font-size:10pt;font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;\">The second function, charging the battery pack, is accomplished by the charger, which converts alternating current (usually from a wall outlet or other electricity source) into direct current that can be accepted by the battery. Tesla vehicles can recharge on a wide variety of electricity sources due to the design of this charger, from a common household outlet to high power circuits meant for more industrial uses. In most markets, Tesla vehicles come with a Mobile Connector that allows for multiple different charging services to be used. In many markets, Tesla offers a Tesla Wall Connector that can be set up to provide higher power charging than the Mobile Connectors.</p> <p style=\"Background-color:#FFFFFF;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:9pt;text-indent:4.54%;color:#000000;font-size:10pt;font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;\">On the road, customers can also charge using our Supercharger network or at a variety of destinations that have deployed our charging equipment.

Conventional all-wheel drive vehicles distribute power to the wheels from a single engine driving a complex mechanical transmission system. By contrast, Tesla&#8217;s dual motor powertrain digitally and independently controls torque to the front and rear wheels. The almost instantaneous response of the motors, combined with low centers of gravity provides drivers with controlled performance and increased traction control. </p> <p style=\"Background-color:#FFFFFF;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:13pt;margin-left:2.27%;text-indent:0%;font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;color:#000000;font-size:10pt;font-family:Times New Roman;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;\">Vehicle Control and Infotainment Software </p> <p style=\"Background-color:#FFFFFF;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:4pt;text-indent:4.54%;font-size:10pt;font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;\">The performance and safety systems of our vehicles and their battery packs require sophisticated control software. There are numerous processors in our vehicles to control these functions, and we write custom firmware for many of these processors. The flow of electricity between the battery pack and the motor must be tightly controlled in order to deliver the performance and behavior expected in the vehicle. For example, software algorithms enable the vehicle to mimic the &#8220;creep&#8221; feeling which drivers expect from an internal combustion engine vehicle without having to apply pressure on the accelerator. Similar algorithms control traction, vehicle stability and the sustained acceleration and regenerative braking of the vehicle. Software also is used extensively to monitor the charge state of each of the cells of the battery pack and to manage all of its safety systems. Drivers use the information and control systems in our vehicles to optimize performance, customize vehicle behavior, manage charging modes and times and control all infotainment functions. We develop almost all of this software, including most of the user interfaces, internally. </p> <p style=\"text-align:center;margin-top:12pt;margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:0%;font-size:10pt;font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;\">6</p> <hr style=\"page-break-after:always;width:100%;\"> <p style=\"margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:13pt;margin-left:2.27%;text-indent:0%;font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;color:#000000;font-size:10pt;font-family:Times New Roman;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;\"><font style=\"font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;color:#000000;font-size:10pt;font-family:Times New Roman;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;\">Autopilot Systems</font></p> <p style=\"margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:4pt;text-indent:4.54%;font-size:10pt;font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;\">We have developed an expertise in vehicle autopilot systems, including auto-steering, traffic aware cruise control, lane changing, automated parking, driver warning systems and automated braking functions.

Our autopilot systems relieve our drivers of the most tedious and potentially dangerous aspects of road travel. Although the driver is ultimately responsible for controlling the vehicle, our system provides safety and convenience functionality that allows our customers to rely on it much like the system that airplane pilots use when conditions permit. Our autopilot system leverages an advanced set of hardware including a forward radar, a forward-looking camera, 12 long-range ultrasonic sensors, and a high-precision digitally controlled electric assist braking system. This hardware suite, along with over-the-air firmware updates and field data feedback loops from the onboard camera, radar, ultrasonics, and GPS, enables the system to continually learn and improve its performance. </p> <p style=\"margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:13pt;text-indent:0%;font-weight:bold;font-size:10pt;font-family:Times New Roman;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;\">Vehicle Design and Engineering </p> <p style=\"margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:4pt;text-indent:4.54%;font-size:10pt;font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;\">In addition to the design, development and production of the powertrain, we have created significant in-house capabilities in the design and engineering of electric vehicles and electric vehicle components and systems.

BMW, Daimler, Nissan, Fiat, Ford and Mitsubishi, among others, have electric vehicles available today. Moreover, Porsche, Lexus, Audi, Volkswagen and Volvo, as well as a number of prospective automobile manufacturers, are also developing electric vehicles. Electric vehicles have also already been brought to market in China and other foreign countries and we expect a number of those manufacturers to enter the United States market as well. In addition, several manufacturers, including General Motors, Toyota, Ford, and Honda, are each selling hybrid vehicles, and certain of these manufacturers have announced plug-in versions of their hybrid vehicles. </p> <p style=\"margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:9pt;text-indent:4.54%;font-size:10pt;font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;\">The market for energy storage products is also highly competitive.

We offer performance and all-wheel drive dual motor system options with our 85 kWh Model S. The performance version of our All-Wheel Drive Dual Motor Model S accelerates from 0 to 60 miles per hour in 3.2 seconds, making it the quickest sedan in the world according to <font style=\"font-style:italic;\">Motor Trend</font> magazine.</p> <p style=\"margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:9pt;text-indent:4.54%;font-size:10pt;font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;\">We believe Model S offers a unique combination of functionality, convenience, safety and styling without compromising performance and energy efficiency. With the battery pack in the floor of the vehicle and the motor and gearbox in line with the rear axle, our single motor Model S provides best in class storage space of 31.6 cubic feet, including storage under both the tailgate and the hood. By way of comparison, this storage space exceeds the approximately 14 cubic feet of storage available in the 2015 BMW 5 Series&#160;sedan and the approximately 18 cubic feet of storage available in the 2015 Cadillac XTS. In addition, we have designed Model S to include a third row with two rear-facing child seats, allowing us to offer seating for five adults and two children. Model S is also available with premium luxury features, including a 17 inch touch screen driver interface and our advanced autopilot system.&nbsp;Our autopilot system, which is being progressively enabled over time through over-the-air software updates, includes both safety features such as collision warning systems and automatic braking and convenience features such as traffic aware cruise control.&nbsp;Model S also offers advanced wireless connectivity, such as 3G connectivity, and driver customization of the infotainment and climate control systems of the vehicle.

We consider the purchase price, cost of fuel and the cost of maintenance over a six year ownership period in this calculation. We assume comparable residual values, warranties, insurance costs and promotions and assume that currently available consumer incentives are still available at the time of a Model&#160;S purchase. In addition to the competitive pricing of Model S relative to other premium vehicles, we estimate that customers of electric vehicles will enjoy lower fuel costs. For example, assuming an average of 15,000 miles driven per year, an average electricity cost of 12.1 cents per kilowatt-hour and an average gasoline price of $2.83 per gallon over the full ownership of the vehicle which were the average electricity cost and premium gasoline price in the United States, respectively, for December 2014, and based on our estimate of the energy efficiency of Model S, we estimate that our Model&#160;S could save approximately $1,600 per year less in fuel costs than a comparable premium internal combustion engine sedan. In international markets, where gasoline prices can be 2-3 times those of the United States, the savings are greater. </p> <p style=\"margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:9pt;text-indent:4.54%;font-size:10pt;font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;\">We have designed Model S with an adaptable platform architecture and common electric powertrain that we intend to leverage to create future electric vehicle models, including our Model X.

We designed each of these major elements for our Tesla Roadster and Model S and plan to use much of this technology in Model X, Model 3, our future electric vehicles and powertrain components that we build for other manufacturers. Our powertrain and battery pack have a modular design, enabling future generations of electric vehicles and our stationary storage applications to incorporate a significant amount of this technology. Further, our powertrain is very compact and contains far fewer moving parts than the internal combustion powertrain.

We maintain an internal battery cell testing lab and an extensive performance database of the many available lithium-ion cell vendors and chemistry types. We intend to incorporate the battery cells that provide the best value and performance possible into our battery packs, and we expect this to continue over time as battery cells continue to improve in energy storage capacity, longevity, power delivery and cost. We believe this flexibility will enable us to continue to evaluate new battery cells as they become commercially viable, and thereby optimize battery pack system performance and cost for our current and future vehicles. In addition, we are designing the cell manufacturing equipment for the Tesla Gigafactory to enable <font style=\"color:#000000;\">flexibility in terms of battery chemistry and form factor.&nbsp;</font>We believe our ability to change battery cell chemistries and vendors while retaining our existing investments in software, electronics, manufacturing equipment, testing and vehicle packaging, will enable us to quickly deploy various battery cells into our products and leverage the latest advancements in battery cell technology.</p> <p style=\"Background-color:#FFFFFF;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:9pt;text-indent:4.54%;color:#;font-size:10pt;font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;\">The range of our electric vehicles on a single charge declines principally as a function of usage, time and charging patterns. Customers&#8217; use of their Tesla vehicle as well as the frequency with which they charge the battery of their Tesla vehicle can result in additional deterioration of the battery&#8217;s ability to hold a charge. For example, we currently expect that the Tesla Roadster battery pack will retain approximately 70% of its ability to hold its initial charge after approximately 100,000 miles or seven years, which will result in a decrease to the vehicle&#8217;s initial range. In comparison with the Roadster battery pack, preliminary internal testing and customer results of Model S to date suggest that the retention rate of the Model S battery pack is greater, due to improvements at the battery cell and pack level. In addition, based on internal testing, we estimate that the Model S would have an approximate 5-10% reduction in range when operated continuously in 0&#176;C temperatures.</p> <p style=\"Background-color:#FFFFFF;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:9pt;text-indent:4.54%;color:#;font-size:10pt;font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;\">To date, we have tested hundreds of battery cells of different chemistries, form factors and designs.

The drive inverter also converts the AC generated by regenerative braking back into DC for electrical storage in the battery pack. The drive inverter performs this function by using a high-performance digital signal processor which runs some of the most complicated and detailed software in the vehicle. In so doing, the drive inverter is directly responsible for the performance, high efficiency and overall driving experience of the vehicle.</p> <p style=\"Background-color:#FFFFFF;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:9pt;text-indent:4.54%;color:#;font-size:10pt;font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;\">The second function, charging the battery pack, is accomplished by the charger, which converts alternating current (usually from a wall outlet or other electricity source) into direct current that can be accepted by the battery. Tesla vehicles can recharge on a variety of AC electrical sources, from a common outlet to a high power circuit of up to 22kW, which provides faster recharging. Vehicles in both the United States and Europe come with the Tesla Mobile Connector which enables charging from a variety of different outlets. In other markets, Tesla offers a Tesla Wall Connector that can be hardwired at a wide range of power levels to suit the electrical capabilities of the charging location.</p> <p style=\"Background-color:#FFFFFF;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:9pt;text-indent:4.54%;color:#;font-size:10pt;font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;\">The most common home charging system uses a standard high power and Mobile Connector to charge overnight.&nbsp;On the road, customers can also charge using our Supercharger network or at a variety of destinations that have deployed our charging equipment.&nbsp;In addition, Model S vehicles can also charge at a variety of public charging stations around the world, either natively or through a suite of adapters.<font style=\"font-size:12pt;color:#000000;\"> </font>This flexibility in charging provides customers with additional mobility, while also allowing them to conveniently charge the vehicle overnight at home.</p> <p style=\"text-align:center;margin-top:12pt;margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:0%;font-size:10pt;font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;\">7</p> <hr style=\"page-break-after:always\"> <p style=\"margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:0pt;text-indent:0%;font-size:12pt;font-family:Times New Roman;\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\"Background-color:#FFFFFF;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:13pt;margin-left:2.78%;text-indent:0%;font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;color:#;font-size:10pt;font-family:Times New Roman;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;\">Vehicle Control and Infotainment Software</p> <p style=\"Background-color:#FFFFFF;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:4pt;text-indent:4.54%;color:#;font-size:10pt;font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;\">The performance and safety systems of our vehicles and their battery packs require sophisticated control software. There are numerous processors in our vehicles to control these functions, and we write custom firmware for many of these processors. The flow of electricity between the battery pack and the motor must be tightly controlled in order to deliver the performance and behavior expected in the vehicle. For example, software algorithms enable the vehicle to mimic the &#8220;creep&#8221; feeling which drivers expect from an internal combustion engine vehicle without having to apply pressure on the accelerator. Similar algorithms control traction, vehicle stability and the sustained acceleration and regenerative braking of the vehicle. Software also is used extensively to monitor the charge state of each of the cells of the battery pack and to manage all of its safety systems. Drivers use the information and control systems in our vehicles to optimize performance, customize vehicle behavior, manage charging modes and times and control all infotainment functions. We develop almost all of this software, including most of the user interfaces, internally.&nbsp;<font style=\"color:#000000;\">We are also developing expertise in vehicle autopilot systems, including road tracking, lane changing, automated parking, driver warning systems and automated braking functions.</font></p> <p style=\"margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:13pt;text-indent:0%;font-weight:bold;font-size:10pt;font-family:Times New Roman;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;\">Vehicle Design and Engineering </p> <p style=\"margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:4pt;text-indent:4.54%;font-size:10pt;font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;\">In addition to the design, development and production of the powertrain, we have created significant in-house capabilities in the design and engineering of electric vehicles and electric vehicle components and systems. We design and engineer bodies, chassis, interiors, heating and cooling and low voltage electrical systems in house and to a lesser extent in conjunction with our suppliers. Our team has core competencies in computer aided design and crash test simulations which we expect to reduce the product development time of new models. </p> <p style=\"margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:9pt;text-indent:4.54%;font-size:10pt;font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;\">Several traditional automotive subsystems required substantial redesign and custom optimization to integrate with the powertrain of an electric vehicle. For example, we redesigned the heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system to integrate with the battery thermal management system and to operate without the energy generated from an internal combustion engine. We have developed expertise in integrating these components with the high-voltage power source in the vehicle and in designing components that significantly reduce their load on the vehicle battery pack, thereby maximizing the available range of the vehicle. </p> <p style=\"margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:9pt;text-indent:4.54%;font-size:10pt;font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;\">Additionally, our team has expertise in lightweight materials, a very important characteristic for electric vehicles given the impact of mass on range.

We believe we will also be able to better control costs of inventory, manage warranty service and pricing, maintain and strengthen the Tesla brand, and obtain rapid customer feedback. Further, we believe that by owning our sales network we will avoid the conflict of interest in the traditional dealership structure inherent to most incumbent automobile manufacturers where the sale of warranty parts and repairs by a dealer are a key source of revenue and profit for the dealer but often are an expense for the vehicle manufacturer. </p> <p style=\"text-align:center;margin-top:12pt;margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:0%;font-size:10pt;font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;\">8</p> <hr style=\"page-break-after:always\"> <p style=\"margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:0pt;text-indent:0%;font-size:12pt;font-family:Times New Roman;\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\"margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:13pt;margin-left:2.27%;text-indent:0%;font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;font-size:10pt;font-family:Times New Roman;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;\">Tesla Supercharger Network </p> <p style=\"margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:4pt;text-indent:4.54%;font-size:10pt;font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;\">We are building a network of up to 120 kW fast charging equipment, each called a Tesla Supercharger, throughout North America, Europe and Asia for fast charging of Model S and future Tesla vehicles.

Supercharger stations typically have between four to ten Superchargers and are strategically placed primarily along well-travelled highways to allow Model S owners to enjoy long distance travel with convenient, minimal stops. We currently have 380 Supercharger stations open in North America, Europe, and Asia. Access to the Supercharger network is currently available free of charge to owners of Model S vehicles with the 85 kWh battery pack options and when purchased as an upfront option for 60 kWh.

We have established our own network of sales and service centers and Supercharger stations globally thus creating a unique business model in the automobile industry. We have operationally structured our business in a manner that we believe will enable us to rapidly develop and launch advanced electric vehicles and technologies. We believe our vehicles, electric vehicle engineering expertise, and operational structure differentiates us from incumbent automobile manufacturers. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">We are currently producing and selling our second vehicle, the Model S sedan. Model S is a four door, five-passenger premium sedan that offers exceptional performance, functionality and attractive styling. The Model S inherited many of the electric powertrain innovations we introduced with our first vehicle, the Tesla Roadster which was launched in 2008 and was the first commercially produced and federally compliant EV in the United States. We completed production of approximately 2,500 Tesla Roadsters in January 2012 and began deliveries of Model S in June 2012. As of December&nbsp;31, 2013, we have delivered over 25,000 Model S vehicles in North America and Europe. In 2014, we expect to grow our presence in several international markets with deliveries to commence in China, Japan, the United Kingdom and Australia. Since its launch, Model S has won several awards, including the prestigious <I>Motor Trend</I> Car of the Year for 2013. In November 2013, Model S received 99 out of 100 in an owner survey conducted by <I>Consumer Reports</I>, the highest customer satisfaction score of any car in the world. Our goal is to deliver the highest possible level of ownership satisfaction in every way. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">We are adapting the platform architecture of Model S to develop our Model X crossover. This unique vehicle has been designed to fill the niche between the roominess of a minivan and the style of an SUV, while having high performance features such as a dual motor all-wheel drive system. We revealed a prototype of Model X in February 2012. We currently expect to have production design Model X prototypes on the road by end of year and begin volume deliveries to customers in the spring of 2015. We have also publicly announced our intent to develop a third generation electric vehicle, to which we refer as &#147;Gen&nbsp;III&#148;, which we intend to offer at a lower price point and produce at higher volumes than our Model&nbsp;S in approximately three years. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">We are also building a network of Superchargers in the United States and Europe to enable free and convenient long distance driving. Superchargers allow Model S owners to replenish 50% of the battery pack in as little as 20 minutes. Supercharger stations are strategically placed along well-travelled highways to allow Model S owners to enjoy long distance travel with convenient, minimal stops. As of February&nbsp;19, 2014, we had 90 Supercharger stations open in North America and Europe. We plan to continue to open Supercharger stations in these regions as well as in Asia during 2014 and expect to triple our Supercharger stations during 2014. We expect that Model X and our future cars will be able to use this network. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">We sell and service our electric vehicles through our company-owned sales and service network in North America, Europe and Asia. Our intent is to offer a compelling customer experience while gathering rapid customer feedback and achieving operating efficiencies, better control over the costs of inventory, warranty service, pricing, and the development of the Tesla brand. Our Tesla stores do not carry large vehicle inventories and, as a result, do not require corresponding large floor spaces. We believe the benefits we receive from distribution ownership will enable us to improve the speed of product development and improve the capital efficiency of our business. We believe that this approach provides us with a competitive advantage as compared to incumbent automobile manufacturers. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">In addition to developing our own vehicles, we provide services for the development of full electric powertrain systems and components, and sell electric powertrain components to other automotive manufacturers. We have provided development services and powertrain components to Daimler AG (Daimler) for its Smart fortwo, A-Class, and B-Class electric vehicles. We also have developed a full electric powertrain system for </FONT></P> <p STYLE=\"margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px\"><FONT SIZE=\"1\">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px\" ALIGN=\"center\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">4 </FONT></P> <p Style='page-break-before:always'> <HR SIZE=\"3\" style=\"COLOR:#999999\" WIDTH=\"100%\" ALIGN=\"CENTER\"> <h5 align=\"left\"><a href=\"#toc\">Table of Contents</a></h5> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\"> Toyota Motor Corporation (Toyota) for use in its RAV4 EV and began shipping production components to Toyota in 2012. We also plan to start selling stationary energy storage products for use in homes, commercial sites, and utilities. The applications for these battery systems include backup power, peak demand reduction, demand response, and wholesale electric market services. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">We conduct our powertrain and vehicle manufacturing and assembly operations at the Tesla Factory, our integrated manufacturing facility in Fremont, California, and at our facility in Tilburg, Netherlands. We have recently indicated our intention to build the Tesla Gigafactory, a facility in the United States where we intend to manufacture cells and battery packs for our vehicles and our stationary storage applications. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">Our fully electric vehicles combine zero tailpipe emissions, market leading range on a single charge, impressive acceleration, and pricing competitive with other vehicles in their classes. For example, our Model S accelerates from zero to 60 miles per hour in as little as 4.2 seconds and has a range on a single charge of up to 265 miles. We offer Model S with 60 kWh and 85 kWh battery pack options. Model S has an effective base price of $62,400 and $72,400 in the United States for the 60 kWh and 85 kWh options, respectively, assuming and after giving effect to the continuation of a United States federal tax credit of $7,500 for the purchase of alternative fuel vehicles. Even without the tax credit, we believe our list prices are competitive from a pricing perspective with other premium vehicles. We believe that Model S demonstrates our ability to produce increasingly affordable electric vehicles that offer long-range capabilities and uncompromised performance, energy efficiency, convenience and design. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">The commercial production of a highway capable, fully electric vehicle that meets consumers&#146; range and performance expectations requires substantial design, engineering, and integration work on almost every system of our vehicles. Our roots in Silicon Valley have enabled us to recruit engineers with strong skills in electrical engineering, power electronics and software engineering. We have complemented this talent base with automotive engineers with substantial expertise in vehicle engineering and manufacturing. Our ability to combine expertise in electric powertrain and vehicle engineering provides a broad capability in electric vehicle design and systems integration. We believe these capabilities, coupled with our focus solely on electric vehicle technology as well as our strong in-house engineering and highly vertical manufacturing capacity, will enable us to sustain the electric vehicle industry leadership we created through the production of the Tesla Roadster and Model S. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">Our battery pack and electric powertrain system has enabled us to deliver market-leading range capability on our vehicles at what we believe is a compelling battery cost per kilowatt-hour. Our battery packs use custom electric vehicle lithium-ion battery cells and contain two to three times the energy of any other commercially available electric vehicle battery pack, thereby significantly increasing the range capabilities of our vehicles. Designing an electric powertrain and a vehicle to exploit its energy efficiency has required extensive safety testing and innovation in battery packs, motors, powertrain systems and vehicle engineering. Our proprietary technology includes cooling systems, safety systems, charge balancing systems, battery engineering for vibration and environmental durability, customized motor design and the software and electronics management systems necessary to manage battery and vehicle performance under demanding real-life driving conditions. These technology innovations have resulted in an extensive intellectual property portfolio&#151;as of December&nbsp;31, 2013, we had 203 issued patents and more than 280 pending patent applications with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and internationally in a broad range of areas, including the battery pack and other technologies. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">We are designing our vehicles to enable the cost effective development of our future vehicles. For example, we have designed Model S with a platform architecture, which compactly positions the battery pack, motor and other elements of our powertrain within the frame of the vehicle. We believe this architecture may form the basis of several future vehicles, including our planned Model X, and enable us to efficiently and cost effectively launch these new vehicle models in the future. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">Our design and vehicle engineering capabilities, combined with the technical advancements of our powertrain system, have enabled us to design and develop zero tailpipe emission vehicles that we believe </FONT></P> <p STYLE=\"margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px\"><FONT SIZE=\"1\">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px\" ALIGN=\"center\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">5 </FONT></P> <p Style='page-break-before:always'> <HR SIZE=\"3\" style=\"COLOR:#999999\" WIDTH=\"100%\" ALIGN=\"CENTER\"> <h5 align=\"left\"><a href=\"#toc\">Table of Contents</a></h5> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\"> overcome the design, styling, and performance issues that we believe have historically limited broad consumer adoption of electric vehicles.

We currently estimate that the cost to fuel our vehicles is approximately one-fifth that of comparable internal combustion vehicles in the United States, and even less internationally where gasoline prices are typically higher. We also expect our electric vehicles will have lower relative maintenance costs than hybrid, plug-in hybrid, or internal combustion engine vehicles due to fewer moving parts and the absence of certain components, including oil, oil filters, spark plugs and engine valves. Additionally, government incentives that are currently available can reduce the cost of ownership even further. </FONT></P></TD></TR></TABLE> <P STYLE=\"font-size:6px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px\">&nbsp;</P> <TABLE STYLE=\"BORDER-COLLAPSE:COLLAPSE\" BORDER=\"0\" CELLPADDING=\"0\" CELLSPACING=\"0\" WIDTH=\"100%\"> <TR> <TD WIDTH=\"5%\"><FONT SIZE=\"1\">&nbsp;</FONT></TD> <TD WIDTH=\"2%\" VALIGN=\"top\" ALIGN=\"left\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">&#149;</FONT></TD> <TD WIDTH=\"1%\" VALIGN=\"top\"><FONT SIZE=\"1\">&nbsp;</FONT></TD> <TD ALIGN=\"left\" VALIGN=\"top\"> <P ALIGN=\"left\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\"><I>High-Performance Without Compromised Design or Functionality.</I> We believe we have been able to successfully overcome the design and performance tradeoff issues that encumbered most early electric vehicle designs.

In addition, we designed Model S to incorporate a modular battery pack in the floor of the vehicle, enabling it to be rapidly swapped out at certain of our service centers and specialized commercial battery exchange facilities that we anticipate may be available in the future. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">We believe Model S offers a unique combination of functionality, convenience, safety and styling without compromising performance and energy efficiency. With the battery pack in the floor of the vehicle and the motor and gearbox in line with the rear axle, Model S provides best in class storage space of 31.6 cubic feet, including storage under both the tailgate and the hood. By way of comparison, this storage space exceeds the approximately 14 cubic feet of storage available in the 2014 BMW 5 Series&nbsp;sedan and the approximately 18 cubic feet of storage available in the 2014 Cadillac XTS. In addition, we have designed Model S to include a third row with two rear-facing child seats, allowing us to offer seating for five adults and two children. Model S is also available with premium luxury features, including a 17 inch touch screen driver interface, advanced </FONT></P> <p STYLE=\"margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px\"><FONT SIZE=\"1\">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px\" ALIGN=\"center\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">6 </FONT></P> <p Style='page-break-before:always'> <HR SIZE=\"3\" style=\"COLOR:#999999\" WIDTH=\"100%\" ALIGN=\"CENTER\"> <h5 align=\"left\"><a href=\"#toc\">Table of Contents</a></h5> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\"> wireless connectivity, such as 3G connectivity, and driver customization of the infotainment and climate control systems of the vehicle. We designed Model S to be incorporate new functionality through wireless updates, which allows us to continually improve Model S over time. Model S has also achieved a five star safety rating. We believe the combination of performance, safety, styling, convenience and energy efficiency of Model S positions it as a compelling alternative to other vehicles in the luxury and performance segments. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">The 60 kWh and 85 kWh battery pack options of Model&nbsp;S have an effective base price of $62,400, and $72,400, respectively, in the United States, assuming and after giving effect to the continuation of a United States federal tax credit of $7,500 for the purchase of alternative fuel vehicles. We also offer a performance version of Model S for an effective base price of $85,900. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">We have designed Model S to provide a lower cost of ownership as compared to other vehicles in its class. We consider the purchase price, cost of fuel and the cost of maintenance over a six year ownership period in this calculation. We assume comparable residual values, warranties, insurance costs and promotions and assume that currently available consumer incentives are still available at the time of a Model&nbsp;S purchase. In addition to the competitive pricing of Model S relative to other premium vehicles, we estimate that customers of electric vehicles will enjoy lower fuel costs. For example, assuming an average of 15,000 miles driven per year, an average electricity cost of 11.8 cents per kilowatt-hour and an average gasoline price of $3.24 per gallon over the full ownership of the vehicle which were the average electricity cost and gasoline price in the United States, respectively, for December 2013, and based on our estimate of the energy efficiency of Model S, we estimate that our Model&nbsp;S could save approximately $1,800 per year less in fuel costs than a comparable premium internal combustion engine sedan. In international markets, where gasoline prices can be 2-3 times those of the United States, the savings are greater. Furthermore, we expect Model S will have lower maintenance costs than comparable premium internal combustion engine sedans due to fewer moving parts and the absence of certain components, including oil, oil filters, spark plugs and engine valves. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">We have designed Model S with an adaptable platform architecture and common electric powertrain that we intend to leverage to create future electric vehicle models, including our Model X. In particular, by designing our electric powertrain within the chassis to accommodate different vehicle body styles, we believe that we can save significant time in future vehicle development. In addition, we believe our strategy of using currently available battery cells will enable us to leverage improvements in cell chemistries and rapidly introduce planned vehicles with different range options. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:2%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\"><B><I>The Tesla Roadster </I></B></FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">Our first vehicle, the Tesla Roadster, is the first high-performance electric sports car. The two-seat, convertible Tesla Roadster has a combination of range, style, performance and energy efficiency that we believe is unmatched in the market today. It can accelerate from zero to 60 miles per hour in as little as 3.7 seconds and has a maximum speed of approximately 120 miles per hour. The Tesla Roadster also has a range of 245 miles on a single charge, as determined using the United States EPA&#146;s combined two-cycle city/highway test. We have sold approximately 2,500 Tesla Roadsters to customers in over 30 countries, predominately in North America and Europe. We concluded the production run of the Tesla Roadster in January 2012. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:2%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\"><B><I>Model X </I></B></FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">In February 2012, we revealed an early prototype of the Model X crossover as the first vehicle we intend to develop by leveraging the Model S platform. This unique vehicle has been designed to fill the niche between the roominess of a minivan and the style of an SUV, while having high performance features such as a dual motor all-wheel drive system. Model X will seat seven adults. We anticipate that we will make Model X available with 60 kWh and 85 kWh battery pack options, with pricing of each version similar to those of a comparably equipped Model S. We currently intend to target an initial annual production rate of approximately 20,000 vehicles per year from our Tesla Factory.

From May 2009 through December 2012, we provided approximately 2,700 battery packs and chargers for the Smart fortwo and A-Class vehicles. We have completed these programs and are now providing development services to Daimler for its B-Class electric vehicle. We also have developed a full electric powertrain system for Toyota for use in its RAV4 EV and began shipping production systems to Toyota in 2012. As of December&nbsp;31, 2013 we have shipped over 1,600 units. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">We are continuing to perform our electric powertrain component and systems sales and marketing activities principally out of our Palo Alto facility. This facility, which also serves as our corporate headquarters, houses our research and development services, including cell and component testing and prototyping, as well as manufacturing of powertrain components for sales to third parties. Manufacturing of our powertrain components is performed at the Tesla Factory. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:2%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\"><B><I>Stationary Energy Storage Applications </I></B></FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">In 2013, we developed stationary energy storage products for use in homes, commercial sites and utilities. The applications for these battery systems include backup power, peak demand reduction, demand response and wholesale electric market services. We plan to ramp sales of these products in 2014. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\"><B>Technology </B></FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">We believe the core competencies of our company are powertrain, vehicle engineering and innovative manufacturing. Our core intellectual property is contained within our electric powertrain and the ability to design a vehicle which capitalizes on the uniqueness of an electric powertrain. Our electric powertrain consists of the following: battery pack, power electronics, motor, gearbox and the control software which enables the components to operate as a system. We designed each of these major elements for our Tesla Roadster and Model S and plan to use much of this technology in Model X, Gen III, our future electric vehicles and powertrain components that we build for other manufacturers. Our powertrain and battery pack have a modular design, enabling future generations of electric vehicles to incorporate a significant amount of this technology. Further, our powertrain is very compact and contains far fewer moving parts than the internal combustion powertrain. These features enable us to adapt it for a variety of applications, including our future vehicles and any powertrain components we build for other manufacturers. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:2%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\"><B><I>Battery Pack </I></B></FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">We design our battery packs to safely store significant amounts of energy and to have long lives.

In addition, we have designed our battery packs to be modular so that we can leverage technology developments across our different vehicles and products. Our proprietary technology includes cooling systems, safety systems, charge balancing systems, battery engineering for vibration and environmental durability, robotic manufacturing processes, customized motor design and the software and electronics management systems necessary to manage battery and vehicle performance under demanding real-life driving conditions. We have significant experience and expertise in the safety and management systems needed to work with lithium-ion cells in the demanding automotive environment. We believe these advancements have enabled us to produce a battery pack at a low cost per kilowatt-hour. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">We believe one of our core competencies is the design of our complete battery pack system. We have designed our battery pack system to permit flexibility with respect to battery cell chemistry, form factor and vendor that we adopt for battery cell supply. In so doing, we believe that we can leverage the substantial battery cell investments and advancements being made globally by battery cell manufacturers to continue to improve the cost per kilowatt-hour of our battery pack. We maintain an internal battery cell testing lab and an extensive performance database of the many available lithium-ion cell vendors and chemistry types. We intend to incorporate the battery cells that provide the best value and performance possible into our battery packs, and we expect this to continue over time as battery cells continue to improve in energy storage capacity, longevity, power delivery and cost. We believe this flexibility will enable us to continue to evaluate new battery cells as they become commercially viable, and thereby optimize battery pack system performance and cost for our current and future vehicles. We believe our ability to change battery cell chemistries and vendors while retaining our existing investments in software, electronics, testing and vehicle packaging, will enable us to quickly deploy various battery cells into our products and leverage the latest advancements in battery cell technology. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">The range of our electric vehicles on a single charge declines principally as a function of usage, time and charging patterns. Customers&#146; use of their Tesla vehicle as well as the frequency with which they charge the battery of their Tesla vehicle can result in additional deterioration of the battery&#146;s ability to hold a charge. For example, we currently expect that the Tesla Roadster battery pack will retain approximately 70% of its ability to hold its initial charge after approximately 100,000 miles or seven years, which will result in a decrease to the vehicle&#146;s initial range. In comparison with the Roadster battery pack, we expect that the retention rate of the Model S battery pack is greater, due to improvements at the battery cell and pack level. In addition, based on internal testing, we estimate that the Model S would have an approximate 5-10% reduction in range when operated continuously in 0&deg;C temperatures. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">To date, we have tested hundreds of battery cells of different chemistries, form factors and designs. Based on this evaluation, we are presently using lithium-ion battery cells based on the 18650 form factor in all of our battery packs. We intend to use the same battery cell form factor in Model X. We entered into a supply agreement with Panasonic Corporation (Panasonic) for the use of Panasonic&#146;s battery cells in Model S and Model X. We expect these battery cells to exhibit better performance and longer lifetimes than the battery cells used in the Tesla Roadster. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:2%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\"><B><I>Power Electronics </I></B></FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">The power electronics in our electric powertrain govern the flow of electrical current throughout the car, primarily the current that flows into and out of the battery pack. The power electronics have two primary functions, the control of torque generation in the motor while driving and the control of energy delivery back into the battery pack while charging. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">The first function is accomplished through the drive inverter, which converts direct current (DC) from the battery pack into alternating current (AC) to drive our three-phase induction motors. The drive inverter also converts the AC generated by regenerative braking back into DC for electrical storage in the battery pack. The drive inverter performs this function by using a high-performance digital signal processor which runs some of the most complicated and detailed software in the vehicle. In so doing, the drive inverter is directly responsible for the performance, high efficiency and overall driving experience of the vehicle. </FONT></P> <p STYLE=\"margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px\"><FONT SIZE=\"1\">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px\" ALIGN=\"center\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">9 </FONT></P> <p Style='page-break-before:always'> <HR SIZE=\"3\" style=\"COLOR:#999999\" WIDTH=\"100%\" ALIGN=\"CENTER\"> <h5 align=\"left\"><a href=\"#toc\">Table of Contents</a></h5> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">The second function, charging the battery pack, is accomplished by the charger, which converts alternating current (usually from a wall outlet or other electricity source) into direct current that can be accepted by the battery. Tesla vehicles can recharge on a variety of AC electrical outlets, from a common outlet of 15 amps and 120 volts up to a high power circuit of 80 amps and 240 volts, which provides faster recharging. The most common home charging system uses a 14-50 type outlet at 40 amps and 240 volts to recharge at an EPA equivalent rate of 29 miles per hour of charge time. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">In the United States, Model S vehicles are delivered with an SAE 1772 industry standard adapter that enables public AC charging at thousands of stations. The European version of Model S has an industry standard vehicle inlet connector that is also compatible with public charge stations around Europe. Vehicles in both the United States and Europe also come with the Tesla Mobile Connector which enables charging from a variety of different outlets for customers who want a portable solution with maximum flexibility. For the fastest possible charging, we offer a high-voltage, direct current option for Model S that enables the vehicle to charge from Tesla&#146;s Supercharger network. Superchargers are able to replenish 50% of the battery pack in as little as 20 minutes of charge time. This flexibility in charging provides customers with additional mobility, while also allowing them to conveniently charge the vehicle overnight at home. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:2%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\"><B><I>Vehicle Control and Infotainment Software </I></B></FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">The performance and safety systems of our vehicles and their battery packs require sophisticated control software. There are numerous processors in our vehicles to control these functions, and we write custom firmware for many of these processors. The flow of electricity between the battery pack and the motor must be tightly controlled in order to deliver the performance and behavior expected in the vehicle. For example, software algorithms enable the vehicle to mimic the &#147;creep&#148; feeling which drivers expect from an internal combustion engine vehicle without having to apply pressure on the accelerator. Similar algorithms control traction, vehicle stability and the sustained acceleration and regenerative braking of the vehicle. Software also is used extensively to monitor the charge state of each of the cells of the battery pack and to manage all of its safety systems. Drivers use the information and control systems in our vehicles to optimize performance, customize vehicle behavior, manage charging modes and times and control all infotainment functions. We develop almost all of this software, including most of the user interfaces, internally. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\"><B>Vehicle Design and Engineering </B></FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">In addition to the design, development and production of the powertrain, we have created significant in-house capabilities in the design and engineering of electric vehicles and electric vehicle components and systems. We design and engineer bodies, chassis, interiors, heating and cooling and low voltage electrical systems in house and to a lesser extent in conjunction with our suppliers. Our team has core competencies in computer aided design and crash test simulations which we expect to reduce the product development time of new models. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">Several traditional automotive subsystems required substantial redesign and custom optimization to integrate with the powertrain of an electric vehicle. For example, we redesigned the heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system to integrate with the battery thermal management system and to operate without the energy generated from an internal combustion engine. In addition, low voltage electric systems which power features such as the radio, power windows, and heated seats also needed to be designed specifically for use in an electric vehicle. We have developed expertise in integrating these components with the high-voltage power source in the vehicle and in designing components that significantly reduce their load on the vehicle battery pack, thereby maximizing the available range of the vehicle. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">Additionally, our team has expertise in lightweight materials, a very important characteristic for electric vehicles given the impact of mass on range. The Tesla Roadster is built with an internally-designed carbon fiber body which provides a balance of strength and mass. Model S is built with a lightweight aluminum body and chassis which incorporates a variety of materials and production methods that help optimize the weight of the vehicle. </FONT></P> <p STYLE=\"margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px\"><FONT SIZE=\"1\">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px\" ALIGN=\"center\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">10 </FONT></P> <p Style='page-break-before:always'> <HR SIZE=\"3\" style=\"COLOR:#999999\" WIDTH=\"100%\" ALIGN=\"CENTER\"> <h5 align=\"left\"><a href=\"#toc\">Table of Contents</a></h5> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\"><B>Sales and Marketing </B></FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:2%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\"><B><I>Company-Owned Stores and Galleries </I></B></FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">We market and sell cars directly to consumers through an international network of company-owned stores and galleries. Our Tesla stores and galleries are highly visible, premium outlets in major metropolitan markets, some of which combine retail sales and service.

As a result, we have complemented our store strategy with sales facilities and personnel in service centers to more rapidly expand our retail footprint. We refer to these as &#147;Service Plus&#148; locations. Including our Service Plus locations, we now operate a network of over 80 sales and gallery locations in North America, Europe and Asia.

Our customers deal directly with our own Tesla-employed sales and service staff, creating what we believe is a differentiated buying experience from the buying experience consumers have with franchised automobile dealers and service centers. We believe we will also be able to better control costs of inventory, manage warranty service and pricing, maintain and strengthen the Tesla brand, and obtain rapid customer feedback. Further, we believe that by owning our sales network we will avoid the conflict of interest in the traditional dealership structure inherent to most incumbent automobile manufacturers where the sale of warranty parts and repairs by a dealer are a key source of revenue and profit for the dealer but often are an expense for the vehicle manufacturer. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:2%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\"><B><I>Tesla Supercharger Network </I></B></FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">We are building a network of up to 120 kWh fast charging equipment, each called a Tesla Supercharger, throughout North America and Europe for fast charging of Model S. The Tesla Supercharger is an industrial grade, high speed charger designed to replenish 50% of the battery pack in as little as 20 minutes. Supercharger stations are strategically placed along well-travelled highways to allow Model S owners to enjoy long distance travel with convenient, minimal stops. As of February&nbsp;19, 2014, we have 90 Supercharger stations open in North America and Europe. In the United States, we have implemented Superchargers across a major transcontinental route, as well as along key routes in the East and West Coasts. In Europe, Superchargers enable long distance travel along key routes in Norway, the Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland and Austria. Access to the Supercharger network is currently available free of charge to owners of Model S vehicles with the 85 kWh battery pack options and when purchased as an upfront option for 60 kWh.

While we have not identified a final site for this facility, we currently expect that it will be located in one of the following states: Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico or Texas. We currently expect the facility to be built on a lot between 500 and 1,000 acres in size, with up to approximately 10 million square feet of production space with one or two levels. At full implementation, the Tesla Gigafactory is expected to have 6,500 dedicated Tesla and production partner employees. We currently plan to commence supplying battery packs manufactured at the Tesla Gigafactory for our vehicles, including the Gen III vehicle, and stationary storage applications, in approximately three years. The Tesla Gigafactory is currently expected to attain full production capacity in 2020, which is anticipated to be sufficient for the production of approximately 500,000 vehicles annually and stationary storage applications. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">We believe that the Tesla Gigafactory will allow us to achieve a major reduction in the cost of our battery packs of greater than 30% on a per kWh basis by the end of the first year of volume production of Gen III.

We have developed close relationships with several key suppliers particularly in the procurement of cells and certain other key system parts. While we obtain components from multiple sources whenever possible, similar to other automobile manufacturers, many of the components used in our vehicles are purchased by us from a single source. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">To date, we have not qualified alternative sources for most of the single sourced components used in our vehicles and we generally do not maintain long-term agreements with our suppliers. While we believe that we may be able to establish alternate supply relationships and can obtain or engineer replacement components for our single source components, we may be unable to do so in the short term or at all at prices or costs that are favorable to us. For example, while several sources of the battery cell we have selected for our battery packs are available, we have fully qualified only two cells from one supplier for these cells. Any disruption in the supply of either battery cells could temporarily disrupt production of the vehicles until such time as a different cell is fully qualified and there can be no assurance that we would be able to successfully retain alternative sources of supply on a timely basis. Moreover, battery cell manufacturers may not supply us at reasonable prices or on reasonable terms or may choose to refuse to supply electric vehicle manufacturers to the extent they determine that the vehicles are not sufficiently safe. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">We use various raw materials in our business including aluminum, steel, nickel and copper. The prices for these raw materials fluctuate depending on market conditions and global demand for these materials. We believe that we have adequate supplies or sources of availability of the raw materials necessary to meet our manufacturing and supply requirements. There are always risks and uncertainties, however, with respect to the supply of raw materials that could impact their availability in sufficient quantities or reasonable prices to meet our needs. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:2%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\"><B><I>Quality Control </I></B></FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">Our quality control efforts are divided between product quality and supplier quality, both of which are focused on designing and producing products and processes with high levels of reliability.

As the equipment purchased would otherwise have been subject to California state sales and use tax, we believe this incentive resulted in tax savings by us of approximately $31&nbsp;million over the period starting in December 2009 and ending in December 2013. The equipment purchases were used only for three purposes: (i)&nbsp;to establish our production facility for Model&nbsp;S in California, (ii)&nbsp;to upgrade our Palo Alto powertrain production facility, and (iii)&nbsp;to expand our current Tesla Roadster assembly operations at our Menlo Park facility.

Currently, the states of Arizona, California, Connecticut, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island and Vermont have such laws in effect. These laws provide that a manufacturer of may earn credits, referred to as ZEV credits, if they produce more zero emission vehicles than the minimum quantity required by those laws.&nbsp;Those manufacturers with a surplus of credits&nbsp;may sell those excess credits to other manufacturers who can then apply such credits to comply with the regulatory requirements, including making up for deficits.

In this scenario, it is possible that activities related to marketing, advertising, taking orders, taking reservations and reservation payments, and delivering vehicles could be viewed by a state as conducting unlicensed activities in the state or otherwise violating the state&#146;s motor vehicle industry laws. Regulators in these states may require us to hold and meet the requirements of appropriate dealer or other licenses and, in states in which manufacturers are prohibited from acting as dealers, may otherwise prohibit or impact our planned activities. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">In jurisdictions where we do not have a Tesla store, a customer may try to purchase our vehicles over the internet. However, some states have laws providing that a manufacturer cannot deliver a vehicle to a resident of such state except through a dealer licensed to do business in that state which may be interpreted to require us to open a store in such state in order to sell vehicles to its residents. In some states where we have opened a viewing &#147;gallery&#148; that is not a full retail location, it is possible that a state regulator could take the position that activities at our gallery constitute an unlicensed motor vehicle dealership and thereby violates applicable manufacturer-dealer laws. Although we would prefer that a state regulator address any concerns by discussing such concerns with us and requesting voluntary compliance, a state could also take action against us, including levying fines or requiring that we refrain from certain activities. In addition, some states have requirements that service facilities be available with respect to vehicles sold in the state, which may be interpreted to also require that service facilities be available with respect to vehicles sold over the internet to residents of the state thereby limiting our ability to sell vehicles in states where we do not maintain service facilities. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">The foregoing examples of state laws governing the sale of motor vehicles are just some of the regulations we face as we sell our vehicles. In many states, the application of state motor vehicle laws to our specific sales model is largely without precedent, particularly with respect to sales over the internet, and would be determined by a fact specific analysis of numerous factors, including whether we have a physical presence or employees in the applicable state, whether we advertise or conduct other activities in the applicable state, how the sale transaction is structured, the volume of sales into the state, and whether the state in question prohibits manufacturers from acting as dealers. As a result of the fact specific and untested nature of these issues, and the fact that applying these laws intended for the traditional automobile distribution model to our sales model allows for some interpretation and discretion by the regulators, state legal prohibitions may prevent us from selling to consumers in such state. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">Moreover, as we expand our footprint in the United States, Dealer Associations have been bringing litigation challenging the legality of our operations, as well as trying to use administrative and legislative processes to shut down our ability to expand and even threatening existing operations. Although we have prevailed in every lawsuit brought by these Dealer Associations in Massachusetts, New York and Ohio, we expect that additional challenges will be brought.

Prior to the introduction of the Nissan Leaf in December 2010, no mass produced performance highway-capable electric vehicles were being sold in the United States. In Japan, Mitsubishi has been selling its electric iMiEV since April 2010. We expect additional competitors to enter the alternate fuel vehicle market within the next several years, and as they do so, we expect that we will experience significant competition. In addition, we currently face strong competition from existing automobile manufacturers in the extremely competitive premium sedan market, including Audi, BMW, Lexus and Mercedes. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">Many established and new automobile manufacturers have entered or have announced plans to enter the alternative fuel vehicle market.

For example, BMW plans to introduce its i3 city car and i8 sports car in the second quarter of 2014 and Volkswagen plans to introduce its fully electric e-Golf in 2014. Several new start-ups have also announced plans to enter the market for performance electric vehicles, although none of these have yet come to market. Finally, electric vehicles have already been brought to market in China and other foreign countries and we expect a number of those manufacturers to enter the United States market as well. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">In addition, several manufacturers, including General Motors, Toyota, Ford, and Honda, are each selling hybrid vehicles, and certain of these manufacturers have announced plug-in versions of their hybrid vehicles. For example, in December 2010, General Motors introduced the Chevrolet Volt, which is a plug-in hybrid vehicle that operates purely on electric power for a limited number of miles, at which time an internal combustion engine engages to recharge the battery. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">Most of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing and other resources than we do and may be able to devote greater resources to the design, development, manufacturing, distribution, promotion, sale and support of their products. Virtually all of our competitors have more extensive customer bases and broader customer and industry relationships than we do. In addition, almost all of these companies have longer operating histories and greater name recognition than we do. Our competitors may be in a stronger position to respond quickly to new technologies and may be able to design, develop, market and sell their products more effectively. We believe our exclusive focus on electric vehicles and electric vehicle components, as well as our history of vehicle development and production, are the basis on which we can compete in the global automotive market in spite of the challenges posed by our competition; however, we have a limited history of operations. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\"><B>Intellectual Property </B></FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">Our success depends, at least in part, on our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property.

As of December&nbsp;31, 2012, we had delivered approximately 2,450 Tesla Roadsters to customers in over 30 countries. While we have concluded the production run of the Tesla Roadster, its proprietary electric vehicle powertrain system is the foundation of our business. We modified this system for our Model S sedan and plan to continue to enhance it for use in our future electric vehicles, including our Model X crossover. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">We began shipments of our second vehicle, the Model&nbsp;S sedan, in June 2012. Model S is a four door, five-passenger premium sedan that offers exceptional performance, functionality and attractive styling. As of December&nbsp;31, 2012, we have produced over 3,100 Model S vehicles and delivered approximately 2,650. We achieved our steady-state production run rate of 20,000 vehicles per year in December 2012. Model S has won several awards, including the prestigious <I>Motor Trend</I> Car of the Year for 2013. As of December&nbsp;31, 2012, we have received over 15,000 customer reservations (after deliveries and cancellations made during the year) for Model S with a minimum refundable payment of $5,000. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">We are adapting the platform architecture of the Model S to develop our Model X crossover. We revealed a prototype of Model X in February 2012 and plan to begin production in late 2014. This unique vehicle has been designed to fill the niche between the roominess of a minivan and the style of an SUV, while having high performance features such as a dual motor all-wheel drive system. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">In addition to developing our own vehicles, we provide services for the development of full electric powertrain systems and components, and sell electric powertrain components to other automotive manufacturers. We have provided development services and powertrain components to Daimler AG (Daimler) for its Smart fortwo, A-Class, and B-Class electric vehicles. We also have developed a full electric powertrain system for Toyota Motor Corporation (Toyota) for use in its RAV4 EV and began shipping production components to Toyota in 2012. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">We sell and service our electric vehicles through our company-owned sales and service network in North&nbsp;America, Europe and Asia. Our intent is to offer a compelling customer experience while gathering rapid customer feedback and achieving operating efficiencies, better control over the costs of inventory, warranty service, pricing, and the development of the Tesla brand. Our Tesla stores do not carry large vehicle inventories and, as a result, do not require corresponding large floor spaces. We believe the benefits we receive from distribution ownership will enable us to improve the speed of product development and improve the capital efficiency of our business. We believe that this approach provides us with a competitive advantage as compared to incumbent automobile manufacturers. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">Our fully electric vehicles combine zero tailpipe emissions, market leading range on a single charge, impressive acceleration, and pricing competitive with other vehicles in their classes.

Even without the tax credit, we believe our list prices are competitive from a pricing perspective with other premium vehicles. We believe that Model S demonstrates our ability to produce increasingly affordable electric vehicles that offer long-range capabilities and uncompromised performance, energy efficiency, convenience and design. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">The commercial production of a highway capable, fully electric vehicle that meets consumers&#146; range and performance expectations requires substantial design, engineering, and integration work on almost every system of our vehicles. Our roots in Silicon Valley have enabled us to recruit engineers with strong skills in electrical engineering, power electronics and software engineering. We have complemented this talent base with automotive engineers with substantial expertise in vehicle engineering and manufacturing. Our ability to combine expertise in electric powertrain and vehicle engineering provides a broad capability in electric vehicle design and systems integration. We believe these capabilities, coupled with our focus solely on electric vehicle technology as well as our strong in-house engineering and manufacturing capacity, will enable us to sustain the electric vehicle industry leadership we created through the production of the Tesla Roadster and Model S. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">Our battery pack and electric powertrain system has enabled us to deliver market-leading range capability on our vehicles at what we believe is a compelling battery cost per kilowatt-hour. Our battery packs use commercially available lithium-ion battery cells and contain two to three times the energy of any other commercially available electric vehicle battery pack, thereby significantly increasing the range capabilities of our vehicles. Designing an electric powertrain and a vehicle to exploit its energy efficiency has required extensive safety testing and innovation in battery packs, motors, powertrain systems and vehicle engineering. Our proprietary technology includes cooling systems, safety systems, charge balancing systems, battery engineering for vibration and environmental durability, customized motor design and the software and electronics management systems necessary to manage battery and vehicle performance under demanding real-life driving conditions. These technology innovations have resulted in an extensive intellectual property portfolio&#151;as of December&nbsp;31, 2012, we had 117 issued patents and more than 258 pending patent applications with the United&nbsp;States Patent and Trademark Office and internationally in a broad range of areas. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">We are designing our vehicles to enable the cost effective development of our future vehicles. For example, we have designed Model S with a platform architecture, which compactly positions the battery pack, motor and other elements of our powertrain within the frame of the vehicle. We believe this architecture will form the basis of several future vehicles, including our planned Model X crossover, and enable us to efficiently and cost effectively launch these new vehicle models in the future. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">Our design and vehicle engineering capabilities, combined with the technical advancements of our powertrain system, have enabled us to design and develop zero tailpipe emission vehicles that we believe overcome the design, styling, and performance issues that we believe have historically limited broad consumer adoption of electric vehicles.

We began customer deliveries in June 2012. As of December&nbsp;31, 2012, we had produced over 3,100 Model S vehicles and delivered approximately 2,650. In addition, as of December&nbsp;31, 2012, we had received over 15,000 customer reservations (after deliveries and cancellations made during the year) with a minimum refundable payment of $5,000. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">We offer Model S with a variety of battery pack options &#150; 40 kWh, 60 kWh and 85 kWh &#150; which offer a range on a single charge of up to 265 miles. To complement its range capabilities, we also offer the capability to fast charge Model S vehicles equipped with either the 60 kWh or 85 kWh battery packs at our Supercharger facilities. The fast charge capability allows Model S owners to replenish 50% of the battery pack in as little as 30 minutes. In addition, we designed Model S to incorporate a modular battery pack in the floor of the vehicle, enabling it to be rapidly swapped out at certain of our service centers and specialized commercial battery exchange facilities that we anticipate may be available in the future. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">We believe Model S offers a compelling combination of functionality, convenience and styling without compromising performance and energy efficiency. With the battery pack in the floor of the vehicle and the motor and gearbox in line with the rear axle, Model S provides best in class storage space of 31.6 cubic feet, including storage under both the tailgate and the hood. By way of comparison, this storage space exceeds the approximately 14 cubic feet of storage available in the 2009 BMW 5 Series&nbsp;sedan and the approximately 21 cubic feet of storage available in the 2009 Lincoln Town Car. In addition, we have designed Model S to include a third row with two rear-facing child seats, allowing us to offer seating for five adults and two children. Model S is also available with premium luxury features, including a 17 inch touch screen driver interface, advanced wireless connectivity, such as 3G connectivity, and driver customization of the infotainment and climate control systems of the vehicle. We have designed Model S with the intent to achieve a five star safety rating. We believe the intended combination of performance, styling, convenience and energy efficiency of Model S will help position it as a compelling alternative to other vehicles in the luxury and performance segments. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">The 40&nbsp;kWh, 60 kWh and 85 kWh battery pack options of Model&nbsp;S will have an effective base price of $52,400, $62,400, and $72,400, respectively, in the United States, assuming and after giving effect to the continuation of a United States federal tax credit of $7,500 for the purchase of alternative fuel vehicles. Even without the tax credit, we believe the base list prices will be competitive with those of other premium vehicles. We also offer a performance version of Model S. Equipped with the 85 kWh battery pack and a high performance drive inverter, the Model S performance version accelerates from zero to 60 miles per hour in 4.4 seconds. The effective base price of the Model S performance version is $87,400. </FONT></P> <p STYLE=\"margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px\"><FONT SIZE=\"1\">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px\" ALIGN=\"center\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">6 </FONT></P> <p Style='page-break-before:always'> <HR SIZE=\"3\" style=\"COLOR:#999999\" WIDTH=\"100%\" ALIGN=\"CENTER\"> <h5 align=\"left\"><a href=\"#toc\">Table of Contents</a></h5> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">We have designed Model S to provide a lower cost of ownership as compared to other vehicles in its class. We consider the purchase price, cost of fuel and the cost of maintenance over a six year ownership period in this calculation. We assume comparable residual values, warranties, insurance costs and promotions and assume that currently available consumer incentives are still available at the time of a Model&nbsp;S purchase. In addition to the competitive pricing of Model S relative to other premium vehicles, we estimate that customers of electric vehicles will enjoy lower fuel costs. For example, assuming an average of 12,000 miles driven per year, an average electricity cost of 11.2 cents per kilowatt-hour and an average gasoline price of $3.32 per gallon over the full ownership of the vehicle which were the average electricity cost and gasoline price in the United States, respectively, for January 2013, and based on our estimate of the energy efficiency of Model S, we estimate that our Model&nbsp;S could have approximately $1,800 per year less in fuel costs than a comparable premium internal combustion engine sedan. Furthermore, we expect Model S will have lower maintenance costs than comparable premium internal combustion engine sedans due to fewer moving parts and the absence of certain components, including oil, oil filters, spark plugs and engine valves. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:2%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\"><B><I>The Tesla Roadster </I></B></FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">Our first vehicle, the Tesla Roadster, is the first high-performance electric sports car. The two-seat, convertible Tesla Roadster has a combination of range, style, performance and energy efficiency that we believe is unmatched in the market today. It can accelerate from zero to 60 miles per hour in as little as 3.7 seconds and has a maximum speed of approximately 120 miles per hour. The Tesla Roadster also has a range of 245 miles on a single charge, as determined using the United States EPA&#146;s, combined two-cycle city/highway test. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">As of December&nbsp;31, 2012, we had delivered almost all of our remaining inventory of Tesla Roadsters to customers in over 30 countries, almost all of which were sold to customers in North America and Europe. The Tesla Roadster complies with, or is exempt from, all applicable vehicle safety standards in the United States, the European Union as well as in select other countries. To date, our customers have driven the Tesla Roadster for an estimated aggregate of almost 30&nbsp;million miles. We concluded the production run of the Tesla Roadster in January 2012. We are selling our remaining Tesla Roadsters primarily in Europe and Asia until our inventory is depleted. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:2%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\"><B><I>Model X and Future Vehicle Roadmap </I></B></FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">We have designed Model S with an adaptable platform architecture and common electric powertrain that we intend to leverage to create future electric vehicle models. In particular, by designing our electric powertrain within the chassis to accommodate different vehicle body styles, we believe that we can save significant time in future vehicle development. In addition, we believe our strategy of using commercially available battery cells will enable us to leverage improvements in cell chemistries and rapidly introduce planned vehicles with different range options. However, we may make changes to the design of Model S and Model X, including changes that may make it more difficult to use the Model S platform for Model X and other future vehicles. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">In February 2012, we revealed an early prototype of the Model X crossover as the first vehicle we intend to develop by leveraging the Model S platform. This unique vehicle has been designed to fill the niche between the roominess of a minivan and the style of an SUV, while having high performance features such as a dual motor all-wheel drive system. The Model X will seat seven adults. We currently plan to start production of Model X in late 2014. We anticipate that we will make Model X available with 60&nbsp;kWh and 85 kWh battery pack options, with pricing of each version similar to those of a comparably equipped Model S. We currently intend to target an annual production rate of approximately 10,000 -15,000 cars per year from our Tesla Factory. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">We have also publicly announced our intent to develop a third generation electric vehicle to be produced at the Tesla Factory.

From May 2009 through December 2012, we provided approximately 2,700 battery packs and chargers for the Smart fortwo and A-Class vehicles. We have completed these programs and are now providing development services to Daimler for its B-Class electric vehicle. We also have developed a full electric powertrain system for Toyota for use in its RAV4 EV and began shipping production systems to Toyota in 2012. Our production activities under this program are expected to continue through 2014. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">We are continuing to perform our electric powertrain component and systems activities principally out of our Palo Alto facility.

Our core intellectual property is contained within our electric powertrain. Our electric powertrain consists of the following: battery pack, power electronics, motor, gearbox and the control software which enables the components to operate as a system. We designed each of these major elements for our Tesla Roadster and Model S and plan to use much of this technology in Model X, our future electric vehicles and powertrain components that we build for other manufacturers. Our powertrain and battery pack have a modular design, enabling future generations of electric vehicles to incorporate a significant amount of this technology. Further, our powertrain is very compact and contains far fewer moving parts than the internal combustion powertrain. These features enable us to adapt it for a variety of applications, including our future vehicles and any powertrain components we build for other manufacturers. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\"><B><I>Battery Pack </I></B> </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">We design our battery packs to safely store significant amounts of energy and to have long lives. For example, we have designed our Tesla Roadster battery packs to store 53 kilowatt hours of useful energy and to have a life of over 100,000 miles or seven years. In addition, we have designed our battery packs to be modular so that we can leverage technology developments across our different vehicles and products. Our proprietary technology includes cooling systems, safety systems, charge balancing systems, battery engineering for vibration and environmental durability, robotic manufacturing processes, customized motor design and the software and electronics management systems necessary to manage battery and vehicle performance under demanding real-life driving conditions. We have significant experience and expertise in the safety and management systems needed to work with lithium-ion cells in the demanding automotive environment.

We have designed our battery pack system to permit flexibility with respect to battery cell chemistry, form factor and vendor that we adopt for battery cell supply. In so doing, we believe that we can leverage the substantial battery cell investments and advancements being made globally by battery cell manufacturers to continue to improve the cost per kilowatt-hour of our battery pack. We maintain an internal battery cell testing lab and an extensive performance database of the many available lithium-ion cell vendors and chemistry types. We intend to incorporate the battery cells that provide the best value and performance possible into our battery packs, and we expect this to continue over time as battery cells continue to improve in energy storage capacity, longevity, power delivery and cost.

We believe our ability to change battery cell chemistries and vendors while retaining our existing investments in software, electronics, testing and vehicle packaging, will enable us to quickly deploy various battery cells into our products and leverage the latest advancements in battery cell technology. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">The range of our electric vehicles on a single charge declines principally as a function of usage, time and charging patterns. A customer&#146;s use of their Tesla vehicle as well as the frequency with which they charge the battery of their Tesla vehicle can result in additional deterioration of the battery&#146;s ability to hold a charge. For example, we currently expect that the Tesla Roadster battery pack will retain approximately 60-65% of its ability to hold its initial charge after approximately 100,000 miles or seven years, which will result in a decrease to the vehicle&#146;s initial range. In addition, based on internal testing, we estimate that our Tesla Roadster would have a 5-10% reduction in range when operated in -20&deg;C temperatures. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">To date, we have tested hundreds of battery cells of different chemistries, form factors and designs. Based on this evaluation, we are presently using lithium-ion battery cells based on the 18650 form factor in all of our battery packs. These battery cells are commercially available in large quantities. We currently intend to use the same battery cell form factor in Model X. We entered into a supply agreement with Panasonic Corporation (Panasonic) for the use of Panasonic&#146;s battery cells in Model S. We expect these battery cells to exhibit better performance and longer lifetimes than the battery cells used in the Tesla Roadster. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:2%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\"><B><I>Power Electronics </I></B></FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">The power electronics in our electric powertrain govern the flow of electrical current throughout the car, primarily the current that flows into and out of the battery pack. The power electronics has two primary functions, the control of torque generation in the motor while driving and the control of energy delivery back into the battery pack while charging. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">The first function is accomplished through the drive inverter, which converts direct current (DC) from the battery pack into alternating current (AC) to drive our three-phase induction motors. The drive inverter also converts the AC generated by regenerative braking back into DC for electrical storage in the battery pack. The drive inverter performs this function by using a high-performance digital signal processor which runs some of the most complicated and detailed software in the vehicle. In so doing, the drive inverter is directly responsible for the performance, high efficiency and overall driving experience of the vehicle. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">The second function, charging the battery pack, is accomplished by the charger, which converts alternating current (usually from a wall outlet or other electricity source) into direct current which can be accepted by the battery. The charger enables us to use any available source of power to charge our vehicle. Our vehicles can recharge on any electrical outlet from a common outlet of 15 amps and 120 volts all the way up to a high power outlet of 70 amps and 240 volts, which provides faster recharging. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">Since the charger system is built into our vehicles, it is possible to charge our vehicles using a variety of power outlets. For example, charging the Tesla Roadster battery pack to full capacity will take approximately 7&nbsp;hours using a 240 volt, 40 amp outlet that is widely available in many homes in the United States for electric appliances. A high power connection capable of 240 volts and 70 amps reduces this charging time to about 4.5&nbsp;hours. Such a connection can be installed in many homes with the assistance of a qualified electrician. For additional flexibility, the Tesla Roadster battery pack can also be charged with a 120 volt, 15 amp connection. Using this lower power output, the Tesla Roadster battery pack can be charged to full capacity in about 42 hours. This flexibility in charging provides customers with additional mobility, while also allowing them to conveniently charge the vehicle overnight at home. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">We offer a high-voltage, direct current fast charge option for Model S with the 60 kWh and 85 kWh battery pack options that enable the vehicle to charge from Tesla&#146;s Supercharger network. </FONT></P> <p STYLE=\"margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px\"><FONT SIZE=\"1\">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px\" ALIGN=\"center\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">9 </FONT></P> <p Style='page-break-before:always'> <HR SIZE=\"3\" style=\"COLOR:#999999\" WIDTH=\"100%\" ALIGN=\"CENTER\"> <h5 align=\"left\"><a href=\"#toc\">Table of Contents</a></h5> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:2%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\"><B><I>Motor </I></B></FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">Our powertrains currently use custom designed 3-phase induction motors. We believe we have made several important innovations in our motor design that minimize mass while still providing high power and efficiency. Our motors incorporate a proprietary fabricated copper rotor design. Our motors also include optimized winding patterns that allow for easy manufacture and fit in as much copper as possible to reduce resistance and energy losses. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:2%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\"><B><I>Gearbox </I></B></FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">We have designed custom, single speed gearboxes that are manufactured in-house for the Tesla Roadster and Model S. These gearboxes combine low mass with high efficiency and can match both the speed and torque capabilities of our AC induction motors. In comparison to a gasoline-powered vehicle, the elimination of gear changes contributes to the rapid acceleration characteristics of our vehicles. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:2%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\"><B><I>Control Software </I></B></FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">The performance and safety systems of our vehicles and their battery packs require sophisticated control software. There are numerous processors in our vehicles to control these functions, and we write custom firmware for many of these processors. The flow of electricity between the battery pack and the motor must be tightly controlled in order to deliver the performance and behavior expected in the vehicle. For example, software algorithms enable the vehicle to mimic the &#147;creep&#148; feeling which drivers expect from an internal combustion engine vehicle without having to apply pressure on the accelerator. Similar algorithms control traction, vehicle stability and the sustained acceleration and regenerative braking of the vehicle. Drivers use the information systems in our vehicles to optimize performance and charging modes and times. Software also is used extensively to monitor the charge state of each of the cells of the battery pack and to manage all of its safety systems. In addition to the vehicle control software, we also develop software for the infotainment system of Model&nbsp;S. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\"><B>Vehicle Design and Engineering </B></FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">In addition to the design, development and production of the powertrain, we have created significant in-house capabilities in the design and engineering of electric vehicles and electric vehicle components and systems. We design and engineer bodies, chassis, interiors, heating and cooling and low voltage electrical systems in house and to a lesser extent in conjunction with our suppliers. Our team has core competencies in computer aided design and crash test simulations which we expect to reduce the product development time of new models. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">Several traditional automotive subsystems required substantial redesign and custom optimization to integrate with the powertrain of an electric vehicle. For example, we redesigned the heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system to integrate with the battery thermal management system and to operate without the energy generated from an internal combustion engine. In addition, low voltage electric systems which power features such as the radio, power windows, and heated seats also needed to be designed specifically for use in an electric vehicle. We have developed expertise in integrating these components with the high-voltage power source in the vehicle and in designing components that significantly reduce their load on the vehicle battery pack, thereby maximizing the available range of the vehicle. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">Additionally, our team has expertise in lightweight materials, a very important characteristic for electric vehicles given the impact of mass on range. The Tesla Roadster is built with an internally-designed carbon fiber body which provides a balance of strength and mass. Model S is built with a lightweight aluminum body and chassis which incorporates a variety of materials and production methods that help optimize the weight of the vehicle. </FONT></P> <p STYLE=\"margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px\"><FONT SIZE=\"1\">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px\" ALIGN=\"center\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">10 </FONT></P> <p Style='page-break-before:always'> <HR SIZE=\"3\" style=\"COLOR:#999999\" WIDTH=\"100%\" ALIGN=\"CENTER\"> <h5 align=\"left\"><a href=\"#toc\">Table of Contents</a></h5> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\"><B>Sales and Marketing </B></FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:2%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\"><B><I>Company-Owned Stores and Galleries </I></B></FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">We market and sell cars directly to consumers through an international network of company-owned stores and galleries. Our Tesla stores and galleries are highly visible, premium outlets in major metropolitan markets some of which combine retail sales and service. We intend to build separate sales and service locations in several markets. In April 2011, we opened our store at Santana Row in San Jose, California. The opening of our Santana Row store launched what we believe to be a new retail experience designed to engage and inform potential customers about electric vehicles in general and the advantages of the Tesla experience in particular. We have opened eighteen other locations modeled on this concept to complement our older sales and service locations. In total, we now operate a network of 32 stores and galleries in North America, Europe and Asia.

Our customers deal directly with our own Tesla-employed sales and service staff, creating what we believe is a differentiated buying experience from the buying experience consumers have with franchised automobile dealers and service centers. We believe we will also be able to better control costs of inventory, manage warranty service and pricing, maintain and strengthen the Tesla brand, and obtain rapid customer feedback. Further, we believe that by owning our sales network we will avoid the conflict of interest in the traditional dealership structure inherent to most incumbent automobile manufacturers where the sale of warranty parts and repairs by a dealer are a key source of revenue and profit for the dealer but often are an expense for the vehicle manufacturer. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:2%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\"><B><I>Reservations </I></B></FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">We typically carry very limited inventory of our vehicles at our Tesla stores. While some customers may purchase their vehicles from this inventory, most of our customers choose to customize the appearance of their vehicle. We require an initial refundable reservation payment of at least $5,000 for our vehicles. The reservation payment becomes a nonrefundable deposit once the customer has selected the vehicle specifications and enters into a purchase agreement. We require full payment of the purchase price of the vehicle only upon delivery of the vehicle to the customer. Reservation payments and deposits are used by us to fund, in part, our working capital requirements and help us to align production with demand.

While we believe that we may be able to establish alternate supply relationships and can obtain or engineer replacement components for our single source components, we may be unable to do so in the short term or at all at prices or costs that are favorable to us. For example, while several sources of the battery cell we have selected for our battery packs are available, we have fully qualified only two suppliers for these cells. Any disruption in the supply of battery cells from either vendor could temporarily disrupt production of the vehicles until such time as a different supplier is fully qualified and there can be no assurance that we would be able to successfully retain alternative suppliers on a timely basis. Moreover, battery cell manufactures may not supply us at reasonable prices or on reasonable terms or may choose to refuse to supply electric vehicle manufacturers to the extent they determine that the vehicles are not sufficiently safe. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">We use various raw materials in our business including aluminum, steel, nickel and copper.

Under this EIP Agreement, we agreed that, until November&nbsp;11, 2009, we would not negotiate or enter into any agreements with other parties that would be competitive with the arrangements contemplated for these strategic cooperation areas, unless the results of such arrangement would be marketed solely under the Tesla brand.

The EIP Agreement provides that none of the restrictions set out in that agreement, or in any strategic agreement, would limit us from developing technology with any third party for use in a Tesla-branded product or service or related to the Tesla Roadster or Model&nbsp;S, engaging in any transaction with a company that is not a Daimler competitor, or supplying components for electric powertrains that are designed by third parties. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">The EIP Agreement also provides that if the parties enter into the strategic agreements or further agreements, those agreements will allocate intellectual property rights according to certain principles outlined in the EIP Agreement. In addition, until July 2013, before licensing intellectual property generated outside the scope of any strategic cooperation area to a Daimler competitor, we would first have to offer DNAC the right to license the intellectual property on a non-exclusive, royalty-bearing basis, or on an exclusive basis in the automotive field; and if DNAC requests the latter, we must negotiate such a license in good faith. If no agreement is reached, however, we would be free to license the technology to the Daimler competitor, and DNAC could take a non-exclusive license. Both we and Daimler have the right to terminate the EIP Agreement in the event the other party undergoes, or executes an agreement to undergo, a change of control. Any strategic cooperation agreements entered into between us and Daimler prior to termination will not be affected by such termination. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">To date, with the exception of the development agreement for the Smart fortwo electric drive and the agreement for the development and production of a battery pack and charger for a pilot fleet of Daimler&#146;s A-Class electric vehicles, the strategic agreements described in the EIP Agreement have not been entered into, and there can be no assurance that the parties will ever enter into such agreements. Even if we were to enter into such agreements, the parties may negotiate and agree to terms that are different to those set forth in the EIP Agreement and outlined above.

We refer to such loan facility including amendments thereto, as the DOE Loan Facility. Under the DOE Loan Facility, FFB made available to us two multi-draw term loan facilities in an aggregate principal amount of $465.0&nbsp;million and the DOE agreed to reimburse FFB for any liabilities, losses, costs or expenses incurred by FFB with respect to the term loan facilities.

Currently, the states of Arizona, California, Connecticut, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island and Vermont have such laws in effect. These laws provide that a manufacturer of may earn credits, referred to as ZEV credits, if they produce more zero emission vehicles than the minimum quantity required by those laws.&nbsp;Those manufacturers with a surplus of credits&nbsp;may sell those excess credits to other manufacturers who can then apply such credits to comply with the regulatory requirements, including making up for deficits. As a manufacturer of&nbsp;solely of zero emission vehicles, we have no minimum requirement, and as a result, we earn ZEV credits on each vehicle sold in such states.&nbsp;We have entered into agreements with other automobile manufacturers to sell the ZEV credits that we earn.&nbsp;Recently, California passed amendments to the ZEV mandate that would require all large volume manufacturers (those manufacturers selling 20,000 or more vehicles in California in 2018) to increase the number of zero emission vehicles sold starting in 2018.&nbsp;Under the new requirements, by 2025 up to 15.4% of each large volume manufacturers&#146; fleet must be made of zero emission vehicles.&nbsp;All states that have adopted the California program will amend their programs to conform to the new California standards. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">Additionally, under the Environmental Protection Agency&#146;s (EPA) national greenhouse gas (GHG) emission standards, vehicle manufacturers are required to meet fleet-wide average carbon dioxide emissions standards for cars and trucks at increasingly lower levels annually from 2012 &#150; 2025. Those manufacturers whose fleet wide average&nbsp;fails to meet such standards have a deficit in their emission profile.&nbsp;Those manufacturers whose fleet wide average performs better than such standards may earn credits.&nbsp;Manufacturers may sell excess credits to other manufacturers who can apply such credits to comply with these regulatory requirements.

For Model S, we have certified the vehicle as compliant with all U.S. safety standards without exemptions. Under U.S. law, we are required to certify compliance with, or obtain exemption from all applicable federal motor vehicle safety standards and we have done so with respect to each vehicle we have offered for sale in the United States. Based on testing, engineering analysis, and other information, we have certified that the Tesla Roadster complies with, or is exempt from all applicable NHTSA standards in effect at the time of manufacture by affixing a certification label to each Tesla Roadster sold.

Since we have fewer than 1,000 Tesla Roadsters left to sell, we have no plans to commence testing our Tesla Roadsters for the WVTA to assure compliance with the European Union requirements to permit unlimited sales. Similarly, Australia and Japan have additional testing regulations applicable to high volume manufacturers. We also plan to keep Australian and Japanese sales of our Tesla Roadsters at a low volume, and have no plans to comply with the Australian and Japanese requirements to permit high volume sales in these jurisdictions. For Model S, we plan to conduct full EU WVTA homologation. Based on results from efforts currently underway, we believe Model S will be able to meet all applicable EU standards.

The FTC specifies that we follow testing requirements set forth by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) which further requires that we test using the United States EPA&#146;s combined city and highway testing cycles. In July 2011, the EPA announced new energy efficiency testing methodologies and labeling requirements for electric vehicles. These new requirements, when applied to our vehicles, resulted in a rated range of 265 miles for the 85 kWh battery pack equipped Model S and a rated range of 208 miles for the 60 kWh battery pack equipped Model S. This was a reduction from the advertised 300 mile and 230 mile range of these vehicles, respectively, utilizing methodologies that estimated the range of the vehicles at a steady speed of 55 miles per hour.

To the extent possible, we plan to secure dealer licenses (or the equivalent of a dealer license) and engage in activities as a motor vehicle dealer in so far as we are permitted to do so as we open additional Tesla stores and service centers. Some states do not permit automobile manufacturers to be licensed as dealers or to act in the capacity of a dealer. To sell vehicles to residents of states where we are not licensed as a dealer, to the extent permitted by local law, both the actual sale would generally have to occur out of state. In this scenario, it is possible that activities related to marketing, advertising, taking orders, taking reservations and reservation payments, and delivering vehicles could be viewed by a state as conducting unlicensed activities in the state or otherwise violating the state&#146;s motor vehicle industry laws. Regulators in these states may require us to hold and meet the requirements of appropriate dealer or other licenses and, in states in which manufacturers are prohibited from acting as dealers, may otherwise prohibit or impact our planned activities. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">In jurisdictions where we do not have a Tesla store, a customer may try to purchase our vehicles over the internet. However, some states have laws providing that a manufacturer cannot deliver a vehicle to a resident of such state except through a dealer licensed to do business in that state which may be interpreted to require us to open a store in such state in order to sell vehicles to its residents. In some states where we have opened a viewing &#147;gallery&#148; that is not a full retail location, it is possible that a state regulator could take the position that activities at our gallery constitute an unlicensed motor vehicle dealership and thereby violates applicable manufacturer-dealer laws. Although we would prefer that a state regulator address any concerns by discussing such concerns with us and requesting voluntary compliance, a state could also take action against us, including levying fines or requiring that we refrain from certain activities. In addition, some states have requirements that service facilities be available with respect to vehicles sold in the state, which may be interpreted to also require that service facilities be available with respect to vehicles sold over the internet to residents of the state thereby limiting our ability to sell vehicles in states where we do not maintain service facilities. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">The foregoing examples of state laws governing the sale of motor vehicles are just some of the regulations we face as we sell our vehicles. In many states, the application of state motor vehicle laws to our specific sales model is largely without precedent, particularly with respect to sales over the internet, and would be determined by a fact specific analysis of numerous factors, including whether we have a physical presence or employees in the applicable state, whether we advertise or conduct other activities in the applicable state, how the sale transaction is structured, the volume of sales into the state, and whether the state in question prohibits manufacturers from acting as dealers. As a result of the fact specific and untested nature of these issues, and the fact that applying these laws intended for the traditional automobile distribution model to our sales model allows </FONT></P> <p STYLE=\"margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px\"><FONT SIZE=\"1\">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px\" ALIGN=\"center\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">20 </FONT></P> <p Style='page-break-before:always'> <HR SIZE=\"3\" style=\"COLOR:#999999\" WIDTH=\"100%\" ALIGN=\"CENTER\"> <h5 align=\"left\"><a href=\"#toc\">Table of Contents</a></h5> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\"> for some interpretation and discretion by the regulators, state legal prohibitions may prevent us from selling to consumers in such state. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">California laws, and potentially the laws of other states, restrict the ability of licensed dealers to advertise or take deposits for vehicles before they are available. In November 2007, we became aware that the New Motor Vehicle Board of the California Department of Transportation has considered whether our reservation and advertising policies comply with these laws. To date, we have not received any communications on this topic from the New Motor Vehicle Board or the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) which has the power to enforce these laws. There can be no assurance that the DMV will not take the position that our vehicle reservation or advertising practices violate the law. We expect that if the DMV determines that we may have violated the law, it would initially discuss its concerns with us and request voluntary compliance. If we are ultimately found to be in violation of California law, we might be precluded from taking reservation payments, and the DMV could take other actions against us, including levying fines and requiring us to refund reservation payments. Resolution of any inquiry may also involve restructuring certain aspects of the reservation program. The DMV also has the power to suspend licenses to manufacture and sell vehicles in California, following a hearing on the merits, which it has typically exercised only in cases of significant or repeat violations and/or a refusal to comply with DMV directions. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">Certain states may have specific laws which apply to dealers, or manufacturers selling directly to consumers, or both. For example, the state of Washington requires that reservation payments or other payment received from residents in the state of Washington must be placed in a segregated account until delivery of the vehicle, which account must be unencumbered by any liens from creditors of the dealer and may not be used by the dealer. Consequently, we established a segregated account for reservation payments in the state of Washington in January 2010. There can be no assurance that other state or foreign jurisdictions will not require similar segregation of reservation payment received from customers. Our inability to access these funds for working capital purposes could harm our liquidity. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">Furthermore, while we have performed an analysis of the principal laws in the European Union relating to our distribution model and believe we comply with such laws, we have not performed a complete analysis in all foreign jurisdictions in which we may sell vehicles. Accordingly, there may be laws in jurisdictions we have not yet entered or laws we are unaware of in jurisdictions we have entered that may restrict our vehicle reservation practices or other business practices. Even for those jurisdictions we have analyzed, the laws in this area can be complex, difficult to interpret and may change over time. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">In addition to licensing laws, specific laws and regulations in each of the states (and their interpretation by regulators) may limit or determine how we sell, market, advertise, and otherwise solicit sales, take orders, take reservations and reservation payments, deliver, and service vehicles for consumers and engage in other activities in that state. While we have performed an analysis of laws in certain jurisdictions in which we have Tesla stores, we have not performed a complete analysis in all jurisdictions in which we may sell vehicles. Accordingly, there may be laws in jurisdictions we have not yet entered that may restrict our vehicle reservation practices or other business practices. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\"><B>Competition </B></FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">Competition in the automotive industry is intense and evolving.

Prior to the introduction of the Nissan Leaf in December 2010, no mass produced performance highway-capable electric vehicles were being sold in the United States. In Japan, Mitsubishi has been selling its electric iMiEV since April 2010. We expect additional competitors to enter the United States and Europe within the next several years, and as they do so, we expect that we will experience significant competition. With respect to our Tesla Roadster, we currently face strong competition from established automobile manufacturers, including manufacturers of high-performance vehicles, such as Porsche and Ferrari. In addition, upon the launch of our Model&nbsp;S sedan, we will face competition from existing and future automobile manufacturers in the extremely competitive premium sedan market, including Audi, BMW, Lexus and Mercedes. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">Many established and new automobile manufacturers have entered or have announced plans to enter the alternative fuel vehicle market. For example, Nissan introduced the Nissan Leaf, a fully electric vehicle in December 2010 and Ford introduced the pure electric Ford Focus and plug-in hybrid Ford C-Max Energi and Ford Fusion Energi in 2012. In addition, several manufacturers, including General Motors, Toyota, Ford, and Honda, are each selling hybrid vehicles, and certain of these manufacturers have announced plug-in versions of their hybrid vehicles. For example, in December 2010, General Motors introduced the Chevrolet Volt, which is a plug-in hybrid vehicle that operates purely on electric power for a limited number of miles, at which time an internal combustion engine engages to recharge the battery. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">Moreover, it has been reported that BMW, Daimler, Lexus, Audi, Fiat, Renault and Volkswagen are also developing electric vehicles. Several new start-ups have also announced plans to enter the market for performance electric vehicles, although none of these have yet come to market. Finally, electric vehicles have already been brought to market in China and other foreign countries and we expect a number of those manufacturers to enter the United States market as well. </FONT></P> <p STYLE=\"margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px\"><FONT SIZE=\"1\">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px\" ALIGN=\"center\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">22 </FONT></P> <p Style='page-break-before:always'> <HR SIZE=\"3\" style=\"COLOR:#999999\" WIDTH=\"100%\" ALIGN=\"CENTER\"> <h5 align=\"left\"><a href=\"#toc\">Table of Contents</a></h5> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">Most of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing and other resources than we do and may be able to devote greater resources to the design, development, manufacturing, distribution, promotion, sale and support of their products. Virtually all of our competitors have more extensive customer bases and broader customer and industry relationships than we do. In addition, almost all of these companies have longer operating histories and greater name recognition than we do. Our competitors may be in a stronger position to respond quickly to new technologies and may be able to design, develop, market and sell their products more effectively. We believe our exclusive focus on electric vehicles and electric vehicle components, as well as our history of vehicle development and production, are the basis on which we can compete in the global automotive market in spite of the challenges posed by our competition; however, we have a limited history of operations. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\"><B>Intellectual Property </B></FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">Our success depends, at least in part, on our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of patents, patent applications, trade secrets, including know-how, employee and third party nondisclosure agreements, copyright laws, trademarks, intellectual property licenses and other contractual rights to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our technology. As of December&nbsp;31, 2012, we had 117 issued patents and more than 258 pending patent applications with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and internationally in a broad range of areas. Our issued patents start expiring in 2026. We intend to continue to file additional patent applications with respect to our technology. We do not know whether any of our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents or whether the examination process will require us to narrow our claims. Even if granted, there can be no assurance that these pending patent applications will provide us with protection. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\"><B>Seasonality </B></FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">Sales of the Tesla Roadster have fluctuated on a seasonal basis with increased sales during the spring and summer months in our second and third fiscal quarters relative to our fourth and first fiscal quarters. We note that, in general, automotive sales tend to decline over the winter season and we anticipate that our sales of Model S, Model X and other electric vehicles we introduce in the future may have similar seasonality. However, our limited operating history makes it difficult for us to judge the exact nature or extent of the seasonality of our business. We do not expect our powertrain component sales and development services revenue to be impacted to a significant extent by seasonality. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\"><B>Segment Information </B></FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">We have determined that we operate as one reporting segment, which is the design, development, manufacturing and sales of electric vehicles and electric powertrain components.

We own our sales and service network and have operationally structured our business in a manner that we believe will enable us to rapidly develop and launch advanced electric vehicles and technologies. We believe our vehicles, electric vehicle engineering expertise, and operational structure differentiates us from incumbent automobile manufacturers. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">We are the first company to commercially produce a federally-compliant electric vehicle, the Tesla Roadster, which achieves a market-leading range on a single charge combined with attractive design, driving performance and zero tailpipe emissions. Our Tesla Roadster offers impressive acceleration and performance without producing any tailpipe emissions. The Tesla Roadster&#146;s proprietary electric vehicle powertrain system is the foundation of our business and, with design enhancements, will also form the basis for our Model&nbsp;S sedan, our Model X crossover, as well as future vehicles. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">Model S is in an advanced stage of development and is currently scheduled to commence customer deliveries by July 2012. We expect that Model S will be manufactured with an adaptable platform architecture upon which other future vehicles, including our Model X crossover, will be based. We revealed a prototype of the Model X crossover in February 2012. We plan to start Model X production in late 2013 and ramp up to significant customer deliveries in early 2014. This unique vehicle has been designed to fill the niche between the roominess of a minivan and the style of an SUV, while having high performance features such as a dual motor all-wheel drive system. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">In addition to developing our own vehicles, we provide services for the development of electric powertrain components and sell electric powertrain components to other automotive manufacturers. We have provided development services and powertrain components to Daimler AG (Daimler) for its Smart fortwo and A-Class electric vehicles. We recently announced the receipt of an initial purchase order for the development of a full powertrain system for an additional Mercedes Benz vehicle from Daimler. We also have almost completed a development services program to produce a full electric powertrain system for Toyota Motor Corporation (Toyota) for use in its RAV4 EV. We anticipate beginning to ship these systems to Toyota during the first half of 2012 under our supply and services agreement. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">The commercial production of a highway capable, fully electric vehicle that meets consumers&#146; range and performance expectations requires substantial design, engineering, and integration work on almost every system of our vehicles. Our roots in Silicon Valley have enabled us to recruit engineers with strong skills in electrical engineering, power electronics and software engineering. We have complemented this talent base with automotive engineers with substantial expertise in vehicle engineering and manufacturing. Our ability to combine expertise in electric powertrain and vehicle engineering provides a broad capability in electric vehicle design and systems integration. We believe these capabilities, coupled with our focus solely on electric vehicle technology as well as our strong inhouse engineering and manufacturing capacity, will enable us to sustain the electric vehicle industry leadership we created through the production of the Tesla Roadster. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">We sell and service our Tesla Roadster though our company-owned sales and service network in the North America, Europe and Asia. Our intent is to offer a compelling customer experience while gathering rapid customer feedback and achieving operating efficiencies, better control over the costs of inventory, warranty service, pricing, and the development of the Tesla brand. Our Tesla stores do not carry large vehicle inventories and, as a result, do not require corresponding large floor spaces. We believe the benefits we receive from distribution ownership, combined with our product design based on modularity and common platforms, will enable us to improve the speed of product development and improve the capital efficiency of our business. We believe that this approach provides us with a competitive advantage as compared to incumbent automobile manufacturers. </FONT></P> <p STYLE=\"margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px\"><FONT SIZE=\"1\">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px\" ALIGN=\"center\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">4 </FONT></P> <p Style='page-break-before:always'> <HR SIZE=\"3\" style=\"COLOR:#999999\" WIDTH=\"100%\" ALIGN=\"CENTER\"> <h5 align=\"left\"><a href=\"#toc\">Table of Contents</a></h5> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">Our first vehicle, the Tesla Roadster, can accelerate from zero to 60 miles per hour in 3.9 seconds and has a maximum speed of approximately 120 miles per hour. The Roadster Sport version can accelerate from zero to 60 miles per hour in 3.7 seconds. The Tesla Roadster has a range of 245 miles on a single charge, as determined using the United States Environmental Protection Agency&#146;s (EPA&#146;s), combined two-cycle city/highway test. The Tesla Roadster has a range that is almost double that of any other commercially released electric vehicle and reportedly set a new world distance record of 313 miles on a single charge for a production electric car in a rally across Australia as part of the 2009 Global Green Challenge. As of December&nbsp;31, 2011, we had delivered approximately 2,150 Tesla Roadsters to customers in over 31 countries, almost all of which were sold in North America and Europe. We concluded the production run of the Tesla Roadster in January 2012. We are selling our remaining Tesla Roadsters primarily in Europe and Asia during 2012 until our inventory is depleted.

In October 2011 we invited over three thousand customers and other stakeholders to see and ride in the beta prototypes of Model S at our manufacturing facility in Fremont, California, the Tesla Factory. We have completed the construction of several drivable Model S alpha and beta prototypes, which are currently undergoing detailed testing. We currently plan to begin customer deliveries of Model&nbsp;S by July 2012. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">Model&nbsp;S is a four door, five-passenger premium sedan that offers exceptional performance, functionality and attractive styling. As a fully electric vehicle, Model S will produce zero tailpipe emissions while accelerating from zero to 60 miles per hour in a targeted time of as low as 4.4 seconds in its performance version. The base Model&nbsp;S will have an effective base price of $49,900 in the United States with the 40 kilowatt-hour (kWh) battery pack option, assuming and after giving effect to the continuation of a United States federal tax credit of $7,500 for the purchase of alternative fuel vehicles. Even without the tax credit, we believe the base list price will be competitive from a pricing perspective with other premium vehicles. We believe that Model S will demonstrate our ability to produce increasingly affordable electric vehicles that offer long-range capabilities and uncompromised performance, energy efficiency, convenience and design. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">We plan to offer Model S with a variety of battery pack options&#151;40 kWh, 60 kWh and 85 kWh&#151;which we estimate will offer a range on a single charge of 160 miles, 230 miles, and 300 miles, respectively, while traveling at a steady speed of 55 miles per hour. The EPA&#146;s new fuel economy requirements will require us to label Model S utilizing new and different energy efficiency testing methodologies. These methodologies differ from the one we have used to estimate the range of the vehicles at a steady speed of 55 miles per hour and could reduce the range reported on the required labeling of our vehicles by up to 30% as compared to our current estimates. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">We are designing Model S for a significantly broader customer base than the Tesla Roadster. Accordingly, we currently intend to target an annual production rate of approximately 20,000 cars per year beginning in 2013 from our Tesla Factory. We currently plan to commence deliveries by July 2012 and to deliver approximately 5,000 Model S sedans in 2012. As of December&nbsp;31, 2011, we had received over 8,000 customer reservations with a minimum refundable payment of $5,000. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">We have nearly completed the Tesla Factory, our integrated electric vehicle manufacturing facility in Fremont, California for the manufacture of Model S and its components. In October 2010, we completed the purchase of this facility from New United Motor Manufacturing, Inc. (NUMMI). We intend to use the facility for the production of our Model S vehicle, Model X crossover, and to build our future electric vehicles. We have entered into a loan agreement with the United States Federal Financing Bank and United States Department of Energy (DOE Loan Facility), to arrange loans for up to $465.0&nbsp;million, $363.9&nbsp;million of which is intended for the continued development of Model S and the build out of the Tesla Factory. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">The electric powertrain we developed for the Tesla Roadster has provided the foundational technology for our Model&nbsp;S, our Model X crossover and our future vehicles, and for electric powertrain components and systems </FONT></P> <p STYLE=\"margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px\"><FONT SIZE=\"1\">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px\" ALIGN=\"center\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">5 </FONT></P> <p Style='page-break-before:always'> <HR SIZE=\"3\" style=\"COLOR:#999999\" WIDTH=\"100%\" ALIGN=\"CENTER\"> <h5 align=\"left\"><a href=\"#toc\">Table of Contents</a></h5> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\"> that we are selling to Daimler and its affiliates and that we intend to sell to Toyota. Our electric powertrain consists of the following components: our modular battery pack, our power electronics, gearbox, our motor and control and integration software which enables the components to operate as a system. We sell certain of these components to Daimler and intend to sell these systems to Toyota, and have secured $101.2&nbsp;million of an aggregate $465.0&nbsp;million from our DOE Loan Facility to fund the infrastructure for these powertrain activities.

The battery pack of the Tesla Roadster uses commercially available lithium-ion battery cells and contains 53 kilowatt-hours of usable energy, almost double the energy of any other commercially available electric vehicle battery pack, thereby significantly increasing its range capability. Designing an electric powertrain and a vehicle to exploit its energy efficiency has required extensive safety testing and innovation in battery packs, motors, powertrain systems and vehicle engineering. Our proprietary technology includes cooling systems, safety systems, charge balancing systems, battery engineering for vibration and environmental durability, customized motor design and the software and electronics management systems necessary to manage battery and vehicle performance under demanding real-life driving conditions. These technology innovations have resulted in an extensive intellectual property portfolio&#151;as of December&nbsp;31, 2011, we had 59 issued patents and more than 230 pending patent applications with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and internationally in a broad range of areas. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">We are designing our vehicles to enable the cost effective development of our future vehicles. For example, we are designing a common platform architecture for Model S, which compactly positions the battery pack, motor and other elements of our powertrain within the frame of the vehicle. We believe this architecture will form the basis of several future vehicles, including our planned Model X crossover, and enable us to efficiently and cost effectively launch these new vehicle models in the future. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">Our design and vehicle engineering capabilities, combined with the technical advancements of our powertrain system, have enabled us to design and develop zero tailpipe emission vehicles that we believe overcome the design, styling, and performance issues that we believe have historically limited broad consumer adoption of electric vehicles. As a result, we believe our Tesla Roadster customers enjoy, and Model&nbsp;S customers will enjoy, several benefits, including: </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"font-size:6px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px\">&nbsp;</P> <TABLE STYLE=\"BORDER-COLLAPSE:COLLAPSE\" BORDER=\"0\" CELLPADDING=\"0\" CELLSPACING=\"0\" WIDTH=\"100%\"> <TR> <TD WIDTH=\"5%\"><FONT SIZE=\"1\">&nbsp;</FONT></TD> <TD WIDTH=\"2%\" VALIGN=\"top\" ALIGN=\"left\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">&#149;</FONT></TD> <TD WIDTH=\"1%\" VALIGN=\"top\"><FONT SIZE=\"1\">&nbsp;</FONT></TD> <TD ALIGN=\"left\" VALIGN=\"top\"> <P ALIGN=\"left\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\"><I>Long Range and Recharging Flexibility</I>.

We are offering the capability to fast charge Model S vehicles equipped with either the 60 kWh or 85 kWh battery packs at one of Tesla&#146;s SuperCharger facilities, which we plan to start installing at selected locations in the United States in 2012. We anticipate that the fast charge capability will allow Model S owners to replenish 50% of the battery pack in about 30 minutes. This feature would offer these drivers a rapid and convenient way to recharge their vehicles. In addition, we are designing Model S to incorporate a modular battery pack in the floor of the vehicle, enabling it to be rapidly swapped out at a specialized commercial battery exchange facility that we anticipate may be available in the future. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">We are designing Model S to offer a compelling combination of functionality, convenience and styling without compromising performance and energy efficiency. With the battery pack in the floor of the vehicle and the motor and gearbox in line with the rear axle, we have designed Model S to provide best in class storage space of 36.8 cubic feet, including storage under both the tailgate and the hood. By way of comparison, this storage space exceeds the approximately 14 cubic feet of storage available in the 2009 BMW 5 Series&nbsp;sedan and the approximately 21 cubic feet of storage available in the 2009 Lincoln Town Car. We are also planning to equip Model S with premium luxury features, including a 17 inch touch screen driver interface, advanced wireless connectivity, such as 3G connectivity, and driver customization of the infotainment and climate control systems of the vehicle. We are designing Model S with the intent to achieve a five star safety rating. We believe the intended combination of performance, styling, convenience and energy efficiency of Model S will help position it as a compelling alternative to other vehicles in the luxury and performance segments. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">We have announced that the 45 kWh, 60 kWh and 85 kWh battery pack options of Model&nbsp;S will have an effective base price of $49,900, $59,900, and $69,900, respectively, in the United States, assuming and after giving effect to the continuation of a United States federal tax credit of $7,500 for the purchase of alternative fuel vehicles. Even without the tax credit, we believe the base list price will be competitive with other premium vehicles. We have also announced a performance version of Model S. Equipped with the 85 kWh battery pack and a high performance drive inverter, we anticipate that the Model S performance version will accelerate from zero to 60 miles per hour in 4.4 seconds. The effective base price of the Model S performance version is $84,900. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">We anticipate that the initial units of Model S will be introduced with a Signature Series which will have an 85 kWh battery pack and include certain colors and interior options, some of which may not be available in the general production of Model S. We also offer the Signature Series with a performance version. The effective base price of the Signature Series is $87,900 and the effective base price of the Signature Series performance version is $97,900. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">We are designing Model S to provide a lower cost of ownership as compared to other vehicles in its class. We consider the purchase price, cost of fuel and the cost of maintenance over a six year ownership period in this calculation. We assume comparable residual values, warranties, insurance costs and promotions and assume that currently available consumer incentives are still available at the time of a Model&nbsp;S purchase. In addition to the competitive pricing of Model S relative to other premium vehicles, we estimate that customers of electric vehicles will enjoy lower fuel costs. For example, assuming an average of 12,000 miles driven per year, an average electricity cost of 11.0 cents per kilowatt-hour and an average gasoline price of $3.38 per gallon over the full ownership of the vehicle which were the average electricity cost and gasoline price in the United States, respectively, for January 2012, and based on our estimate of the energy efficiency of Model S, we estimate that our Model&nbsp;S could have approximately $1,900 per year less in fuel costs than a comparable premium internal combustion engine sedan. Furthermore, we expect Model S will have lower maintenance costs than comparable premium internal combustion engine sedans due to fewer moving parts and the absence of certain components, including oil, oil filters, spark plugs and engine valves. </FONT></P> <p STYLE=\"margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px\"><FONT SIZE=\"1\">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px\" ALIGN=\"center\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">8 </FONT></P> <p Style='page-break-before:always'> <HR SIZE=\"3\" style=\"COLOR:#999999\" WIDTH=\"100%\" ALIGN=\"CENTER\"> <h5 align=\"left\"><a href=\"#toc\">Table of Contents</a></h5> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:2%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\"><B><I>Model X and Future Vehicle Roadmap </I></B></FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">We expect that Model S will be manufactured with an adaptable platform architecture and common electric powertrain so that we can use the platform of Model S to create future electric vehicle models. In particular, by designing our electric powertrain within the chassis to accommodate different vehicle body styles, we believe that we can save significant time in future vehicle development. In addition, we believe our strategy of using commercially available battery cells will enable us to leverage improvements in cell chemistries and rapidly introduce planned vehicles with different range options. However, we may make changes to the design of Model&nbsp;S, including changes that may make it more difficult to use the Model S platform for future vehicles. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">In February 2012, we revealed an early prototype of the Model X crossover as the first vehicle we intend to develop by leveraging the Model S platform. This unique vehicle has been designed to fill the niche between the roominess of a minivan and the style of an SUV, while having high performance features such as a dual motor all-wheel drive system. We currently plan to start production of Model X in the fourth quarter of 2013 and ramp up to significant customer deliveries in early 2014. We anticipate that we will make Model X available with 60kWh and 85 kWh battery pack options, with pricing of each version similar to those of a comparably equipped Model S.

This facility, which also serves as our corporate headquarters, houses our research and development services, including cell and component testing and prototyping, as well as manufacturing of powertrain components for sales to third parties. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\"><B>Technology </B></FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">We believe the core competencies of our company are powertrain and vehicle engineering. Our core intellectual property is contained within our electric powertrain. Our electric powertrain consists of the following: battery pack, power electronics, motor, gearbox and the control software which enables the components to operate as a system. We designed each of these major elements for our Tesla Roadster and plan to use much of this technology in Model S, Model X, our future electric vehicles and powertrain components that we build for other manufacturers. Our powertrain and battery pack have a modular design, enabling future generations of electric vehicles to incorporate a significant amount of this technology. Further, our powertrain is very compact and contains far fewer moving parts than the internal combustion powertrain. These features enable us to adapt it for a variety of applications, including our future vehicles and any powertrain components we build for other manufacturers. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:2%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\"><B><I>Battery Pack </I></B></FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">We design our battery packs to safely store significant amounts of energy and to have long lives. For example, we have designed our Tesla Roadster battery packs to store 53 kilowatt hours of useful energy and to have a life of over 100,000 miles or seven years. In addition, we have designed our battery packs to be modular so that we can leverage technology developments across our different vehicles and products. Our proprietary technology includes cooling systems, safety systems, charge balancing systems, battery engineering for vibration and environmental durability, robotic manufacturing processes, customized motor design and the software and electronics management systems necessary to manage battery and vehicle performance under demanding real-life driving conditions. We have significant experience and expertise in the safety and management systems needed to work with lithium-ion cells in the demanding automotive environment. We believe these advancements have enabled us to produce a battery pack at a low cost per kilowatt-hour. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">We believe one of our core competencies is the design of our complete battery pack system.

We maintain an internal battery cell testing lab and an extensive performance database of the many available lithium-ion cell vendors and chemistry types. We intend to incorporate the battery cells that provide the best value and performance possible into our battery packs, and we expect this to continue over time as battery cells continue to improve in energy storage capacity, longevity, power delivery and cost. We believe this flexibility will enable us to continue to evaluate new battery cells as they become commercially viable, and thereby optimize battery pack system performance and cost for our current and future vehicles. We believe our ability to change battery cell chemistries and vendors while retaining our existing investments in software, electronics, testing and vehicle packaging, will enable us to quickly deploy various battery cells into our products and leverage the latest advancements in battery cell technology. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">The range of our electric vehicles on a single charge declines principally as a function of usage, time and charging patterns. A customer&#146;s use of their Tesla vehicle as well as the frequency with which they charge the battery of their Tesla vehicle can result in additional deterioration of the battery&#146;s ability to hold a charge. For example, we currently expect that the Tesla Roadster battery pack will retain approximately 60-65% of its ability to hold its initial charge after approximately 100,000 miles or seven years, which will result in a decrease to the vehicle&#146;s initial range. In addition, based on internal testing, we estimate that our Tesla Roadster would have a 5-10% reduction in range when operated in -20&deg;C temperatures. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">To date, we have tested hundreds of battery cells of different chemistries, form factors and designs. Based on this evaluation, we are presently using lithium-ion battery cells based on the 18650 form factor in all of our battery packs. These battery cells are commercially available in large quantities. We currently intend to use the same battery cell form factor in Model S and Model X. We recently entered into a supply agreement with Panasonic Corporation (Panasonic) for the use of Panasonic&#146;s battery cells in Model S. We expect these battery cells to exhibit better performance and longer lifetimes than the battery cells used in the Tesla Roadster. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:2%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\"><B><I>Power Electronics </I></B></FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">The power electronics in our electric powertrain govern the flow of electrical current throughout the car, primarily the current that flows into and out of the battery pack. The power electronics has two primary functions, the control of torque generation in the motor while driving and the control of energy delivery back into the battery pack while charging. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">The first function is accomplished through the drive inverter, which converts direct current (DC) from the battery pack into alternating current (AC) to drive our three-phase induction motors. The drive inverter also converts the AC generated by regenerative braking back into DC for electrical storage in the battery pack. The drive inverter performs this function by using a high-performance digital signal processor which runs some of the most complicated and detailed software in the vehicle. In so doing, the drive inverter is directly responsible for the performance, high efficiency and overall driving experience of the vehicle. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">The second function, charging the battery pack, is accomplished by the charger, which converts alternating current (usually from a wall outlet or other electricity source) into direct current which can be accepted by the battery. The charger enables us to use any available source of power to charge our vehicle. Our vehicles can recharge on any electrical outlet from a common outlet of 15 amps and 120 volts all the way up to a high power outlet of 70 amps and 240 volts, which provides faster recharging. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">Since the charger system is built into our vehicles, it is possible to charge our vehicles using a variety of power outlets. For example, charging the Tesla Roadster battery pack to full capacity will take approximately 7 hours using a 240 volt, 40 amp outlet that is widely available in many homes in the United States for electric appliances. A high power connection capable of 240 volts and 70 amps reduces this charging time to about 4.5 hours. Such a connection can be installed in many homes with the assistance of a qualified electrician. For additional flexibility, the Tesla Roadster battery pack can also be charged with a 120 volt, 15 amp connection. </FONT></P> <p STYLE=\"margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px\"><FONT SIZE=\"1\">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px\" ALIGN=\"center\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">11 </FONT></P> <p Style='page-break-before:always'> <HR SIZE=\"3\" style=\"COLOR:#999999\" WIDTH=\"100%\" ALIGN=\"CENTER\"> <h5 align=\"left\"><a href=\"#toc\">Table of Contents</a></h5> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\"> Using this lower power output, the Tesla Roadster battery pack can be charged to full capacity in about 42 hours. This flexibility in charging provides customers with additional mobility, while also allowing them to conveniently charge the vehicle overnight at home. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">We offer a high-voltage fast charge option for Model S with the 60 kWh and 85 kWh battery pack options that will enable the vehicle to charge from Tesla&#146;s SuperCharger network that we anticipate may be available in the future. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:2%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\"><B><I>Motor </I></B></FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">Our powertrains currently use custom designed 3-phase induction motors. We believe we have made several important innovations in our motor design that minimize mass while still providing high power and efficiency. Our motors incorporate a proprietary fabricated copper rotor design. Our motors also include optimized winding patterns that allow for easy manufacture and fit in as much copper as possible to reduce resistance and energy losses. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:2%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\"><B><I>Gearbox </I></B></FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">We have designed custom, single speed gearboxes that are manufactured in-house for the Tesla Roadster and Model S. These gearboxes combine low mass with high efficiency and can match both the speed and torque capabilities of our AC induction motors. In comparison to a gasoline-powered vehicle, the elimination of gear changes contributes to the rapid acceleration characteristics of our vehicles. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:2%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\"><B><I>Control Software </I></B></FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">The performance and safety systems of our vehicles and their battery packs require sophisticated control software. There are numerous processors in our vehicles to control these functions, and we write custom firmware for many of these processors. The flow of electricity between the battery pack and the motor must be tightly controlled in order to deliver the performance and behavior expected in the vehicle. For example, software algorithms enable the vehicle to mimic the &#147;creep&#148; feeling which drivers expect from an internal combustion engine vehicle without having to apply pressure on the accelerator. Similar algorithms control traction, vehicle stability and the sustained acceleration and regenerative braking of the vehicle. Drivers use the information systems in our vehicles to optimize performance and charging modes and times. Software also is used extensively to monitor the charge state of each of the cells of the battery pack and to manage all of its safety systems. In addition to the vehicle control software, we are also developing software for the infotainment system of Model&nbsp;S. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\"><B>Vehicle Design and Engineering </B></FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">In addition to the design, development and production of the powertrain, we have created significant in-house capabilities in the design and engineering of electric vehicles and electric vehicle components and systems. We design and engineer bodies, chassis, interiors, heating and cooling and low voltage electrical systems in house and to a lesser extent in conjunction with our suppliers. Our team has core competencies in computer aided design and crash test simulations which we expect to reduce the product development time of new models. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">Several traditional automotive subsystems required substantial redesign and custom optimization to integrate with the powertrain of an electric vehicle. For example, we redesigned the heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system to integrate with the battery thermal management system and to operate without the energy generated from an internal combustion engine. In addition, low voltage electric systems which power features such as the radio, power windows, and heated seats also needed to be designed specifically for use in an electric vehicle. We have developed expertise in integrating these components with the high-voltage power source in the vehicle and in designing components that significantly reduce their load on the vehicle battery pack, thereby maximizing the available range of the vehicle. </FONT></P> <p STYLE=\"margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px\"><FONT SIZE=\"1\">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px\" ALIGN=\"center\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">12 </FONT></P> <p Style='page-break-before:always'> <HR SIZE=\"3\" style=\"COLOR:#999999\" WIDTH=\"100%\" ALIGN=\"CENTER\"> <h5 align=\"left\"><a href=\"#toc\">Table of Contents</a></h5> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">Additionally, our team has expertise in lightweight materials, a very important characteristic for electric vehicles given the impact of mass on range. The Tesla Roadster is built with an internally-designed carbon fiber body which provides a balance of strength and mass. We intend to build Model S with a lightweight aluminum body and have been designing the body and chassis with a variety of materials and production methods that will help optimize the weight of the vehicle. We are developing an integrated electric vehicle manufacturing facility in Fremont, California, the Tesla Factory, to assemble vehicles and manufacture components that are critical to our intellectual property and quality of Model S. Our engineering and manufacturing teams are working alongside one another in an effort to accelerate the Model&nbsp;S development. We believe the co-location of our engineering and manufacturing teams will help accelerate the development of new products and allow for faster introduction of product changes. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\"><B>Sales and Marketing </B></FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:2%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\"><B><I>Company-Owned Sales </I></B></FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">We market and sell cars directly to consumers. Until we opened our first store in Los Angeles, California in May 2008, all of our sales of the Tesla Roadster were conducted via the phone and internet, or in-person at our headquarters and corporate events. Increasingly, sales are being made through our network of Tesla stores. Our Tesla stores are highly visible, premium outlets in major metropolitan markets some of which combine retail sales and service. We intend to build separate sales and service locations in several markets. In April 2011, we opened our store at Santana Row in San Jose, California. The opening of our Santana Row store launched what we believe to be a new retail experience designed to engage and inform potential customers about electric vehicles in general and the advantages of the Tesla experience in particular. We have opened five other locations modeled on this concept to complement a network of 20 sales and service locations in North America, Europe and Asia. We plan to open additional stores and service centers during 2012, with a goal of establishing approximately 50 stores and additional service centers globally within the next several years in connection with our Model&nbsp;S rollout. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">We believe that by owning our own sales and service network we can offer a compelling customer experience while achieving operating efficiencies and capturing sales and service revenues incumbent automobile manufacturers do not enjoy in the traditional franchised distribution and service model. Our customers deal directly with our own Tesla-employed sales and service staff, creating what we believe is a differentiated buying experience from the buying experience consumers have with franchised automobile dealers and service centers. We believe we will also be able to better control costs of inventory, manage warranty service and pricing, maintain and strengthen the Tesla brand, and obtain rapid customer feedback. Further, we believe that by owning our sales network we will avoid the conflict of interest in the traditional dealership structure inherent to most incumbent automobile manufacturers where the sale of warranty parts and repairs by a dealer are a key source of revenue and profit for the dealer but often are an expense for the vehicle manufacturer. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:2%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\"><B><I>Reservations </I></B></FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">We typically carry very limited inventory of our vehicles at our Tesla stores.

However, within three months of purchasing a vehicle, customers may purchase a one-time option to replace the battery pack at any time after the expiration of the New Vehicle Limited Warranty but before the tenth anniversary of the purchase date of the vehicle. For customers that select this option, we agree to replace the original battery pack of the vehicle with a replacement battery pack which will store at least 53 kilowatt-hours of usable energy. Charges in addition to the option purchase price apply if the customer exercises the battery pack replacement option prior to the seventh anniversary of the purchase date of the vehicle. The customer is entitled to a partial refund of the option purchase price if the option is not elected by the eighth anniversary of the purchase date of the vehicle. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\"><B>Manufacturing </B></FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:2%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\"><B><I>Vehicle Assembly </I></B></FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">We completed the production of Tesla Roadster gliders at Lotus Cars Limited in January 2012.

We have developed close relationships with several key suppliers particularly in the procurement of cells and certain electric powertrain components. While we obtain components from multiple sources whenever possible, similar to other automobile manufacturers, many of the components used in our vehicles are purchased by us from a single source. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">To date, we have not qualified alternative sources for most of the single sourced components used in our vehicles and we generally do not maintain long-term agreements with our suppliers. While we believe that we may be able to establish alternate supply relationships and can obtain or engineer replacement components for our single source components, we may be unable to do so in the short term or at all at prices or costs that are favorable to us. For example, while several sources of the battery cell we have selected for our battery packs are available, we have fully qualified only one supplier for these cells. Any disruption in the supply of battery cells from such vendor could temporarily disrupt production of the vehicles until such time as a different supplier is fully qualified and there can be no assurance that we would be able to successfully retain alternative suppliers on a timely basis. Moreover, battery cell manufactures may not supply us at reasonable prices or on reasonable terms or may choose to refuse to supply electric vehicle manufacturers to the extent they determine that the vehicles are not sufficiently safe. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">We use various raw materials in our business including aluminum, steel, nickel and copper.

Under California&#146;s Low-Emission Vehicle Regulations, and similar laws in other states, vehicle manufacturers are required to ensure that a portion of the vehicles delivered for sale in that state during each model year are zero emission vehicles. Currently, the states of Arizona, California, Connecticut, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island and Vermont have such laws in effect. These laws provide that a manufacturer of zero emission vehicles may earn credits, referred to as ZEV credits, and may sell excess credits to other manufacturers who apply such credits to comply with these regulatory requirements. As a manufacturer solely of zero emission vehicles, we earn ZEV credits on each vehicle sold in such states and have entered into agreements with other automobile manufacturers to sell the ZEV credits that we earn. Recently, California passed amendments to the ZEV mandate that would require all large volume manufacturers (those manufacturers selling 20,000 or more vehicles in California) to increase the number of zero emission vehicles sold. Under the new requirements, by 2025 up to 15.4% of each large volume manufacturers&#146; fleet must be made of zero emission vehicles. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">We have entered into three contracts for the sale of ZEV credits with three separate automotive manufacturers.

Under U.S. law, we are required to certify compliance with, or obtain exemption from all applicable federal motor vehicle safety standards and we have done so with respect to each vehicle we have offered for sale in the United States. Based on testing, engineering analysis, and other information, we have certified that the Tesla Roadster complies with, or is exempt from all applicable NHTSA standards by affixing a certification label to each Tesla Roadster sold. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">We are also required to comply with other requirements of federal laws administered by NHTSA, including the Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards, consumer information labeling requirements, early warning reporting requirements regarding warranty claims, field reports, death and injury reports and foreign recalls, and owner&#146;s manual requirements. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">Our vehicles sold in Europe are subject to European Union safety testing regulations. Many of those regulations, referred to as European Union Whole Vehicle Type Approval (WVTA), are different from the federal motor vehicle safety standards applicable in the United States and may require redesign and/or retesting. Our Tesla Roadsters are currently approved for sale on a limited basis in the European Union via the Small Series&nbsp;WVTA, which permits the manufacture and sale in the European Union of no more than 1,000 vehicles per year. Since we have fewer than 1,000 Tesla Roadsters left to sell, we have no plans to commence testing our Tesla Roadsters for the WVTA to assure compliance with the European Union requirements to permit unlimited sales. Similarly, Australia and Japan have additional testing regulations applicable to high volume manufacturers. We also plan to keep Australian and Japanese sales of our Tesla Roadsters at a low volume, and have no plans to comply with the Australian and Japanese requirements to permit high volume sales in these jurisdictions. In connection with the introduction of the Tesla Roadster in Australia and Japan, we conducted a frontal impact test based on European Union testing standards on the Tesla Roadster in November 2009, which is required for sales exceeding certain annual volumes outside the United States. While the Tesla Roadster met most of the criteria for occupant protection and all criteria for high voltage safety in the front impact crash test, there were two criteria that were not met in the test. Based on our analysis of additional compliance options in Australia and Japan, we believe such an outcome should not limit our ability to sell the Tesla Roadster in Australia below certain annual volumes or, subject to compliance with certain Japanese import rules, have a material impact on our ability to sell Tesla Roadsters in Japan. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) requires us to calculate and display the range of our electric vehicles on a label we affix to the vehicle&#146;s window. The FTC specifies that we follow testing requirements set forth by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) which further requires that we test using the United States EPA&#146;s combined city and highway testing cycles. In July 2011, the EPA announced new energy efficiency testing methodologies for electric vehicles. These new requirements, when applied to our vehicles, could reduce the advertised range of our vehicles by up to 30% as compared to methodologies we have used to estimate the range of the vehicles at a steady speed of 55 miles per hour. Shortly after the EPA issued their new requirements, the FTC issued a proposed rule that would harmonize current FTC label requirements with the EPA&#146;s new fuel economy label requirements. If finalized, changes to the testing cycles previously utilized could impair our ability to deliver Model S with the previously advertised range based on the steady speed of 55 miles per hour range methodology, which could result in the cancellation of a number of the over 8,000 reservations that have been placed for Model S as of December&nbsp;31, 2011. Although the real life customer experience of the range of our electric vehicles will not change due to the changes in the FTC or EPA standards, the reduction in the advertised range could negatively impact our sales and harm our business. </FONT></P> <p STYLE=\"margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px\"><FONT SIZE=\"1\">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px\" ALIGN=\"center\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">21 </FONT></P> <p Style='page-break-before:always'> <HR SIZE=\"3\" style=\"COLOR:#999999\" WIDTH=\"100%\" ALIGN=\"CENTER\"> <h5 align=\"left\"><a href=\"#toc\">Table of Contents</a></h5> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">The Automobile Information and Disclosure Act requires manufacturers of motor vehicles to disclose certain information regarding the manufacturer&#146;s suggested retail price, optional equipment and pricing.

Some states do not permit automobile manufacturers to be licensed as </FONT></P> <p STYLE=\"margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px\"><FONT SIZE=\"1\">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px\" ALIGN=\"center\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">22 </FONT></P> <p Style='page-break-before:always'> <HR SIZE=\"3\" style=\"COLOR:#999999\" WIDTH=\"100%\" ALIGN=\"CENTER\"> <h5 align=\"left\"><a href=\"#toc\">Table of Contents</a></h5> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\"> dealers or to act in the capacity of a dealer. To sell vehicles to residents of states where we are not licensed as a dealer, to the extent permitted by local law, both the actual sale and all activities related to the sale would generally have to occur out of state. In this scenario, it is possible that activities related to marketing, advertising, taking orders, taking reservations and reservation payments, and delivering vehicles could be viewed by a state as conducting unlicensed activities in the state or otherwise violating the state&#146;s motor vehicle industry laws. Regulators in these states may require us to hold and meet the requirements of appropriate dealer or other licenses and, in states in which manufacturers are prohibited from acting as dealers, may otherwise prohibit or impact our planned activities. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">In jurisdictions where we do not have a Tesla store, a customer may try to purchase our vehicles over the internet. However, some states, such as Kansas, have laws providing that a manufacturer cannot deliver a vehicle to a resident of such state except through a dealer licensed to do business in that state which may be interpreted to require us to open a store in the state of Kansas in order to sell vehicles to Kansas residents. Such laws may be interpreted to require us to open a store in such state before we sell vehicles to residents of such states. In some states where we have opened a viewing &#147;gallery&#148; that is not a full retail location, it is possible that a state regulator could take the position that activities at our gallery constitute an unlicensed motor vehicle dealership and thereby violates applicable manufacturer-dealer laws. Although we would prefer that a state regulator address any concerns by discussing such concerns with us and requesting voluntary compliance, a state could also take action against us, including levying fines or requiring that we refrain from certain activities. In addition, some states have requirements that service facilities be available with respect to vehicles sold in the state, which may be interpreted to also require that service facilities be available with respect to vehicles sold over the internet to residents of the state thereby limiting our ability to sell vehicles in states where we do not maintain service facilities. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">The foregoing examples of state laws governing the sale of motor vehicles are just some of the regulations we will face as we sell our vehicles. In many states, the application of state motor vehicle laws to our specific sales model is largely without precedent, particularly with respect to sales over the internet, and would be determined by a fact specific analysis of numerous factors, including whether we have a physical presence or employees in the applicable state, whether we advertise or conduct other activities in the applicable state, how the sale transaction is structured, the volume of sales into the state, and whether the state in question prohibits manufacturers from acting as dealers. As a result of the fact specific and untested nature of these issues, and the fact that applying these laws intended for the traditional automobile distribution model to our sales model allows for some interpretation and discretion by the regulators, state legal prohibitions may prevent us from selling to consumers in such state. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">California laws, and potentially the laws of other states, restrict the ability of licensed dealers to advertise or take deposits for vehicles before they are available. In November 2007, we became aware that the New Motor Vehicle Board of the California Department of Transportation has considered whether our reservation and advertising policies comply with these laws. To date, we have not received any communications on this topic from the New Motor Vehicle Board or the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) which has the power to enforce these laws. There can be no assurance that the DMV will not take the position that our vehicle reservation or advertising practices violate the law. We expect that if the DMV determines that we may have violated the law, it would initially discuss its concerns with us and request voluntary compliance. If we are ultimately found to be in violation of California law, we might be precluded from taking reservation payments, and the DMV could take other actions against us, including levying fines and requiring us to refund reservation payments. Resolution of any inquiry may also involve restructuring certain aspects of the reservation program. The DMV also has the power to suspend licenses to manufacture and sell vehicles in California, following a hearing on the merits, which it has typically exercised only in cases of significant or repeat violations and/or a refusal to comply with DMV directions. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">Certain states may have specific laws which apply to dealers, or manufacturers selling directly to consumers, or both. For example, the state of Washington requires that reservation payments or other payment </FONT></P> <p STYLE=\"margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px\"><FONT SIZE=\"1\">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px\" ALIGN=\"center\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">23 </FONT></P> <p Style='page-break-before:always'> <HR SIZE=\"3\" style=\"COLOR:#999999\" WIDTH=\"100%\" ALIGN=\"CENTER\"> <h5 align=\"left\"><a href=\"#toc\">Table of Contents</a></h5> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\"> received from residents in the state of Washington must be placed in a segregated account until delivery of the vehicle, which account must be unencumbered by any liens from creditors of the dealer and may not be used by the dealer. Consequently, we established a segregated account for reservation payments in the state of Washington in January 2010. There can be no assurance that other state or foreign jurisdictions will not require similar segregation of reservation payment received from customers. Our inability to access these funds for working capital purposes could harm our liquidity. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">Furthermore, while we have performed an analysis of the principal laws in the European Union relating to our distribution model and believe we comply with such laws, we have not performed a complete analysis in all foreign jurisdictions in which we may sell vehicles. Accordingly, there may be laws in jurisdictions we have not yet entered or laws we are unaware of in jurisdictions we have entered that may restrict our vehicle reservation practices or other business practices. Even for those jurisdictions we have analyzed, the laws in this area can be complex, difficult to interpret and may change over time. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">In addition to licensing laws, specific laws and regulations in each of the states (and their interpretation by regulators) may limit or determine how we sell, market, advertise, and otherwise solicit sales, take orders, take reservations and reservation payments, deliver, and service vehicles for consumers and engage in other activities in that state. While we have performed an analysis of laws in certain jurisdictions in which we have Tesla stores, we have not performed a complete analysis in all jurisdictions in which we may sell vehicles.

Prior to the introduction of the Nissan Leaf in December 2010, no mass produced performance highway-capable electric vehicles were being sold in the United States. In Japan, Mitsubishi has been selling its electric iMiEV since April 2010. We expect additional competitors to enter the United States and Europe within the next several years, and as they do so, we expect that we will experience significant competition. With respect to our Tesla Roadster, we currently face strong competition from established automobile manufacturers, including manufacturers of high-performance vehicles, such as Porsche and Ferrari. In addition, upon the launch of our Model&nbsp;S sedan, we will face competition from existing and future automobile manufacturers in the extremely competitive premium sedan market, including Audi, BMW, Lexus and Mercedes. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">Many established and new automobile manufacturers have entered or have announced plans to enter the alternative fuel vehicle market. For example, Nissan introduced the Nissan Leaf, a fully electric vehicle in December 2010 and Ford has announced that it plans to introduce the pure electric Ford Focus and plug-in hybrid Ford C-Max in 2012. In addition, several manufacturers, including General Motors, Toyota, Ford, and Honda are each selling hybrid vehicles, and certain of these manufacturers have announced plug-in versions of their hybrid vehicles. For example, in December 2010, General Motors introduced the Chevrolet Volt, which is a plug-in hybrid vehicle that operates purely on electric power for a limited number of miles, at which time an internal combustion engine engages to recharge the battery. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">Moreover, it has been reported that BMW, Daimler, Lexus, Audi, Renault and Volkswagen are also developing electric vehicles. Several new start-ups have also announced plans to enter the market for performance electric vehicles, although none of these have yet come to market. Finally, electric vehicles have already been brought to market in China and other foreign countries and we expect a number of those manufacturers to enter the United States market as well. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">Most of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing and other resources than we do and may be able to devote greater resources to the design, development, manufacturing, distribution, promotion, sale and support of their products. Virtually all of our competitors have more extensive customer bases and broader customer and industry relationships than we do. In addition, almost all of these companies have longer operating histories and greater name recognition than we do. Our competitors may be in a stronger position to respond quickly to new technologies and may be able to design, develop, market and sell their products more effectively. We believe our exclusive focus on electric vehicles and electric vehicle components, as well as our history of vehicle development and production, are the basis on which we can compete in the global automotive market in spite of the challenges posed by our competition; however, we have a limited history of operations. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\"><B>Intellectual Property </B></FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">Our success depends, at least in part, on our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property.

We note that, in general, automotive sales tend to decline over the winter season and we anticipate that our sales of Model S, Model X and other electric vehicles we introduce in the future may have similar seasonality. However, our limited operating history makes it difficult for us to judge the exact nature or extent of the seasonality of our business.

We own our sales and service network and have operationally structured our business in a manner that we believe will enable us to rapidly develop and launch advanced electric vehicles and technologies. We believe our vehicles, electric vehicle engineering expertise, and operational structure differentiates us from incumbent automobile manufacturers. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">We are the first company to commercially produce a federally-compliant electric vehicle, the Tesla Roadster, which achieves a market-leading range on a single charge combined with attractive design, driving performance and zero tailpipe emissions. Our Tesla Roadster offers impressive acceleration and performance without producing any tailpipe emissions. The Tesla Roadster&#146;s proprietary electric vehicle powertrain system is the foundation of our business and, with design enhancements, will also form the basis for our Model&nbsp;S sedan which is currently scheduled to begin production in mid-2012. In addition, we provide services for the development of electric powertrain components and sell electric powertrain components to other automotive manufacturers as evidenced by our development services and sales of battery packs and chargers to Daimler AG (Daimler) for its Smart fortwo and A-Class electric vehicles, and our agreement to produce a validated electric powertrain system for Toyota Motor Corporation (Toyota) for use in its RAV4 EV. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">The commercial production of a highway capable, fully electric vehicle that meets consumers&#146; range and performance expectations required substantial design, engineering, and integration work on almost every system of our Tesla Roadster. Our roots in Silicon Valley have enabled us to recruit engineers with strong skills in electrical engineering, power electronics and software engineering. We have complemented this talent base with automotive engineers with substantial expertise in vehicle engineering and manufacturing. Our ability to combine expertise in electric powertrain and vehicle engineering provides a broad capability in electric vehicle design and systems integration. We believe these capabilities, coupled with our focus solely on electric vehicle technology, will enable us to sustain the electric vehicle industry leadership we created through the production of the Tesla Roadster. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">We sell and service our Tesla Roadster though our company-owned sales and service network. Our intent is to offer a compelling customer experience while achieving operating efficiencies, better control costs of inventory, manage warranty service and pricing, maintain and strengthen the Tesla brand, and obtain rapid customer feedback. Our Tesla stores do not carry large vehicle inventories and, as a result, do not require corresponding large floor spaces. We believe the benefits we receive from distribution ownership, combined with our product design based on modularity and common platforms, will enable us to improve the speed of product development and improve the capital efficiency of our business. We believe that this approach provides us with a competitive advantage as compared to incumbent automobile manufacturers. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">Our first vehicle, the Tesla Roadster, can accelerate from zero to 60 miles per hour in 3.9 seconds and has a maximum speed of approximately 120 miles per hour. The Roadster Sport version can accelerate from zero to 60 miles per hour in 3.7 seconds. The Tesla Roadster has a range of 245 miles on a single charge, as determined using the United States Environmental Protection Agency&#146;s (EPA&#146;s), combined two-cycle city/highway test. Recently, the EPA announced its intention to develop and establish new energy efficiency testing methodologies for electric vehicles, which we believe could result in a significant decrease to the advertised ranges of all electric vehicles, including ours. The Tesla Roadster has a range that is almost double that of any other commercially released electric vehicle and reportedly set a new world distance record of 313 miles on a single charge for a production electric car in a rally across Australia as part of the 2009 Global Green Challenge. The current effective price of the base configuration of the Tesla Roadster is $101,500 in the United States, assuming and after giving effect to the continuation of a currently available United States federal tax credit of $7,500 for the purchase of alternative fuel vehicles. The Tesla Roadster is currently in production, and as of December&nbsp;31, 2010, we had delivered over 1,500 Tesla Roadsters to customers in 31 countries, almost all of which were sold in </FONT></P> <p STYLE=\"margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px\"><FONT SIZE=\"1\">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px\" ALIGN=\"center\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">3 </FONT></P> <p Style='page-break-before:always'> <HR SIZE=\"3\" style=\"COLOR:#999999\" WIDTH=\"100%\" ALIGN=\"CENTER\"> <h5 align=\"left\"><a href=\"#toc\">Table of Contents</a></h5> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\"> North America and Europe. To date, our customers have driven the Tesla Roadster for an estimated aggregate of over 9.0&nbsp;million miles. We have developed extensive software systems to manage the overall efficiency, safety and controls within our vehicles. Additionally, we have met battery shipping and testing protocols of the United Nations, United States Department of Transportation and other government agencies, allowing us to ship the Tesla Roadster to a number of countries throughout the world. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">We announced our second electric vehicle, the Model&nbsp;S, with the public exhibition of a drivable early prototype in March 2009. We currently plan to begin production of the Model&nbsp;S in mid-2012. We are designing the Model&nbsp;S to be a four door, five-passenger premium sedan that offers exceptional performance, functionality and attractive styling. As a fully electric vehicle, the Model&nbsp;S will produce zero tailpipe emissions while accelerating from zero to 60 miles per hour in a targeted time of under 6 seconds. We currently anticipate that the base Model&nbsp;S will have an effective price of $49,900 in the United States with the standard 160 mile battery pack, assuming and after giving effect to the continuation of a United States federal tax credit of $7,500 for the purchase of alternative fuel vehicles. Even without the tax credit, we believe the base list price will be competitive from a pricing perspective with other premium vehicles. We are designing the Model&nbsp;S to offer a variety of range options from 160 miles to 300 miles on a single charge, as projected using the EPA&#146;s combined two-cycle city/highway test. The EPA has announced its intention to develop and establish new energy efficiency testing methodologies for electric vehicles, which we believe could result in a significant decrease to the advertised ranges of all electric vehicles, including ours. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">We anticipate that the initial units of the Model S will be introduced with a Signature Series which will include certain colors and options, some of which may not be available in the general production of the Model S. We also plan to offer the capability to fast charge in as little as 45 minutes at commercial charging stations that we anticipate may be available in the future and the ability to rapidly swap out its battery pack at a specialized commercial battery exchange facility to complement its range capabilities. We believe that the Model&nbsp;S will demonstrate our ability to produce increasingly affordable electric vehicles that offer long-range capabilities and uncompromised performance, energy efficiency, convenience and design. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">We are designing the Model&nbsp;S for a significantly broader customer base than the Tesla Roadster. Accordingly, we currently intend to target an annual production rate of up to approximately 20,000 cars per year from our planned manufacturing facility in Fremont, California. The drivable early prototype of the Model&nbsp;S was exhibited to the public in March 2009 and the first alpha prototype was driving before the end of 2010. As of December&nbsp;31, 2010, we had received approximately 3,400 customer reservations with a minimum refundable payment of $5,000. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">We intend to develop a substantially integrated electric vehicle manufacturing facility in Fremont, California for the manufacture of the Model S and its components. In October 2010, we completed the purchase of this facility from New United Motor Manufacturing, Inc. (NUMMI). We intend to use the facility for the production of our planned Model S vehicle and to build our future electric vehicles. We have entered into a loan agreement with the United States Federal Financing Bank and United States Department of Energy (DOE Loan Facility), to arrange loans for up to $465.0&nbsp;million loan, $363.9&nbsp;million of which is intended for the continued development of the Model&nbsp;S and the build out of our Fremont facility. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">The electric powertrain we developed for the Tesla Roadster has provided the foundational technology for our planned Model&nbsp;S, our future vehicles and for electric powertrain components that we have begun selling to Daimler and its affiliates and that we intend to sell to Toyota. Our electric powertrain consists of only four physical components: our modular battery pack, our power electronics module, gearbox and our motor. This component design contains far fewer moving parts than a gasoline powertrain. These features enable us to adapt it for a variety of vehicle applications.

The battery pack of the Tesla Roadster uses commercially available lithium-ion battery cells and contains 53 kilowatt-hours of usable energy, almost double the energy of any other commercially available electric vehicle battery pack, thereby significantly increasing its range capability. Designing an electric powertrain and a vehicle to exploit its energy efficiency has required extensive safety testing and innovation in battery packs, motors, powertrain systems and vehicle engineering. Our proprietary technology includes cooling systems, safety systems, charge balancing systems, battery engineering for vibration and environmental durability, customized motor design and the software and electronics management systems necessary to manage battery and vehicle performance under demanding real-life driving conditions. These technology innovations have resulted in an extensive intellectual property portfolio&#151;as of February&nbsp;3, 2011, we had 35 issued patents and approximately 280 pending patent applications with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and internationally in a broad range of areas. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">We are designing our vehicles to enable the cost effective development of our future vehicles.

Second, we use upgradeable software extensively for managing vehicle performance and the driver experience. Finally, we are designing a common platform architecture for the Model&nbsp;S, which compactly positions the battery pack, motor and other elements of our powertrain within the frame of the vehicle. We believe this architecture will form the basis of several future vehicles, including our planned Model X crossover vehicle, and enable us to efficiently and cost effectively launch these new vehicle models in the future. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">Our design and vehicle engineering capabilities, combined with the technical advancements of our powertrain system, have enabled us to design and develop zero tailpipe emission vehicles that we believe overcome the design, styling, and performance issues that we believe have historically limited broad consumer adoption of electric vehicles.

The two-seat, convertible Tesla Roadster has a combination of range, style, performance and energy efficiency that we believe is unmatched in the market today. As of December&nbsp;31, 2010, we had delivered over 1,500 Tesla Roadsters to customers in 31 countries, almost all of which were sold to customers in North America and Europe. To date, our customers have driven the Tesla Roadster for an estimated aggregate of over 9.0&nbsp;million miles. The Tesla Roadster complies with, or is exempt from, all applicable vehicle safety standards in the United States, the European Union as well as select other countries. Additionally, we have met battery shipping and testing protocols of the United Nations, United States Department of Transportation and other government agencies, allowing us to ship the Tesla Roadster to a number of countries throughout the world. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">The current effective price of the base configuration of the Tesla Roadster is $101,500 in the United States, assuming and after giving effect to the continuation of a currently available United States federal tax credit of $7,500 for the purchase of alternative fuel vehicles. The Tesla Roadster offers performance characteristics that we believe are among the best in the industry. It can accelerate from zero to 60 miles per hour in 3.9 seconds and has a maximum speed of approximately 120 miles per hour. We believe the Tesla Roadster&#146;s lightweight and proprietary electric powertrain provides significant performance advantages over traditional internal combustion engine-powered sports cars. Specifically, the electric powertrain that delivers peak torque (in excess of 200 foot pounds) at extremely low revolutions per minute, or rpm, and remains near peak through 7,000 rpm of the 13,000 rpm range enables the Tesla Roadster to achieve its high levels of acceleration. With such a long and flat torque curve, we believe the Tesla Roadster delivers a compelling driving experience with instantaneous and sustained acceleration through an extended range of speed. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">The Tesla Roadster combines this performance with high-energy efficiency.

In June 2009, nine months after its commercial introduction, we launched the 2010 Tesla Roadster, known as the Tesla Roadster 2, as well as a high-performance variant, the Tesla Roadster Sport. As compared to the original Tesla Roadster, the Tesla Roadster 2 delivered a higher quality interior, a new push-button gear selector, improved heating and cooling performance, a more powerful electric powertrain and improved noise reduction. New optional features were also added including clear coat carbon fiber trim for the exterior and interior, an adjustable suspension and improved vehicle data connectivity via a GSM module. In addition to making these enhancements, we simultaneously reduced our manufacturing costs significantly by making a number of modifications, including redesigning our power electronics module and switching to certain commodity components in our manufacturing process. The Tesla Roadster Sport offers a higher performance powertrain which improves acceleration from 0 to 60 miles per hour from 3.9 seconds to 3.7 seconds, adjustable suspension and performance tires and forged wheels, all without compromising the efficiency of the Tesla Roadster electric powertrain. The current effective price of the base configuration of the Tesla Roadster Sport is $121,000 in the United States, assuming and after giving effect to the continuation of a currently available United States federal tax credit of $7,500 for the purchase of alternative fuel vehicles. We delivered our first right-hand drive model of the Tesla Roadster in January 2010 and have since delivered right-hand drive Roadsters into key markets such as United Kingdom, Japan, Hong Kong, and Australia. In July 2010, a year after the launch of Roadster 2, we released the Roadster 2.5. As compared to the Roadster 2, the Roadster 2.5 received an upgraded front fascia and front chin spoiler, improved electronics package and double DIN display, redesigned rear diffuser and improved noise reduction. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">The performance and safety systems of the Tesla Roadster and its battery required the development of sophisticated control software. For example, we have implemented several algorithms in our vehicle control software to reduce the likelihood of unintended acceleration of our vehicles in the event of either a mechanical or electronic malfunction. We stop the flow of electricity to our motor when either the car is placed in neutral or the key is rotated from the &#147;on&#148; position. We also stop the flow of electricity to the motor during normal vehicle operation when the brake pedal is depressed for more than two seconds after the accelerator has been depressed. Finally, we have a dedicated processor that monitors the ratio of accelerator position and torque delivered to our motor and will stop the flow of electricity to our motor if the ratio diverges from set parameters. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:2%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\"><B><I>The Tesla Model&nbsp;S </I></B></FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">Our planned second vehicle, the Model&nbsp;S, is currently expected to begin production in mid-2012. We intend to leverage technologies within the electric powertrain of the Tesla Roadster to create a four-door, five adult passenger sedan that produces zero tailpipe emissions while accelerating from zero to 60 miles per hour in a targeted time of under 6 seconds. The drivable early prototype of the Model&nbsp;S was exhibited to the public in March 2009 and as of December&nbsp;31, 2010, we had received approximately 3,400 customer reservations with a minimum refundable payment of $5,000. We intend to make the Model&nbsp;S available with three range variants&#151;160 miles, 230 miles, and 300 miles, on a single charge, as projected using the EPA&#146;s combined city/highway test cycles&#151;to allow customers to purchase an electric vehicle that best matches their personal driving needs.

We are designing the Model&nbsp;S to include a third row with two rear-facing child seats, subject to applicable safety regulations and requirements, allowing us to offer a seven passenger sedan. The EPA has announced its intention to develop and establish new energy efficiency testing methodologies for electric vehicles, which we believe could result in a significant decrease to the advertised ranges of all electric vehicles, including ours. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">To complement its range capabilities, we also plan to offer the Model&nbsp;S with a package of recharging options, including the capability to fast charge in as little as 45 minutes at commercial direct current charging stations that we anticipate may be available in the future. This feature would offer consumers a rapid and convenient way to recharge their vehicles. In addition, we are designing the Model&nbsp;S to incorporate a modular battery pack in the floor of the vehicle, enabling it to be rapidly swapped out at a specialized commercial battery exchange facility. We are designing the Model&nbsp;S to offer a compelling combination of functionality, convenience and styling without compromising performance and energy efficiency. With the battery pack in the floor of the vehicle and the motor and gearbox in line with the rear axle, we are designing the Model&nbsp;S to provide best in class storage space of approximately 29 cubic feet, including storage under both the tailgate and the hood. By way of comparison, this storage space exceeds the approximately 14 cubic feet of storage available in the 2009 BMW 5 Series&nbsp;sedan and the approximately 21 cubic feet of storage available in the 2009 Lincoln Town Car. We are also planning to equip the Model&nbsp;S with premium luxury features, including a 17&#148; touch screen driver interface, advanced wireless connectivity, such as 3G connectivity, and driver customization of the infotainment and climate control systems of the vehicle. We are designing the Model&nbsp;S with the intent to achieve a five star safety rating. We believe the intended combination of performance, styling, convenience and energy efficiency of the Model&nbsp;S will help position it as a compelling alternative to other vehicles in the luxury and performance segments. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">We currently anticipate that the base Model&nbsp;S will have an effective price of $49,900 in the United States with a standard 160 mile range battery pack, assuming and after giving effect to the continuation of a United States federal tax credit of $7,500 for the purchase of alternative fuel vehicles. Even without the tax credit, we believe the base list price will be competitive with other premium vehicles. We have not finalized pricing for the 230 or 300 mile range variants of the Model&nbsp;S. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">We are designing the Model&nbsp;S to provide a lower cost of ownership as compared to other vehicles in its class. We consider the purchase price, cost of fuel and the cost of maintenance over a six year ownership period in this calculation. We assume comparable residual values, warranties, insurance costs and promotions and assume that currently available consumer incentives are still available at the time of a Model&nbsp;S purchase. In addition to the competitive pricing of the Model&nbsp;S relative to other premium vehicles, we estimate that customers of electric vehicles will enjoy lower fuel costs. For example, assuming an average of 12,000 miles driven per year, an average electricity cost of 11.7 cents per kilowatt-hour and an average gasoline price of $2.86 per gallon over the full ownership of the vehicle which were the average electricity cost and gasoline price in the United States, respectively, for November 2010, and based on our estimate of the energy efficiency of the Model&nbsp;S, we estimate that our planned Model&nbsp;S could have approximately $1,400 per year less in fuel costs than a comparable premium internal combustion engine sedan. Furthermore, we expect the planned Model&nbsp;S will have lower maintenance costs than comparable premium internal combustion engine sedans due to fewer moving parts and the absence of certain components, including oil, oil filters, spark plugs and engine valves. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:2%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\"><B><I>Future Vehicle Roadmap Based on Model&nbsp;S Platform </I></B></FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">We intend to design the Model&nbsp;S with an adaptable platform architecture and common electric powertrain so that we can use the platform of the Model&nbsp;S to create future electric vehicle models, such as a crossover/sport utility vehicle, a van or a cabriolet.

Our core intellectual property is contained within our electric powertrain. This powertrain is fundamentally composed of five major elements: a modular battery pack, a power electronics module, a motor, a gearbox and the control software which enables the components to operate as a system. We designed each of these major elements for our Tesla Roadster and plan to use much of this technology in the Model&nbsp;S and our future electric vehicles. Our powertrain and battery pack have a modular design, enabling future generations of electric vehicles to incorporate a significant amount of this technology. Further, our powertrain is very compact and contains far fewer moving parts than the internal combustion powertrain. These features enable us to adapt it for a variety of applications, including our future vehicles and any powertrain components we build for other manufacturers. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">From time to time, we intend to enter into development arrangements with other automobile manufacturers for electric powertrain development activities. From inception through December&nbsp;31, 2009, our powertrain development activities were exclusively pursuant to a development arrangement entered into in 2008, which was formalized pursuant to an agreement entered into in May 2009 with Daimler, related to the development of a battery pack and charger for Daimler&#146;s Smart fortwo electric drive. All amounts received under this development agreement were recognized as an offset to research and development expenses in the consolidated statement of operations. During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009, our research and development expenses were $19.3 million after such offsets. As of December&nbsp;31, 2009 all development work related to the development agreement had been completed and we had recognized the full $23.2&nbsp;million under the development agreement. During the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 and 2008, research and development expenses were $93.0 million and $53.7 million, respectively. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">As of December&nbsp;31, 2010, we had 212 employees in our powertrain research and development department. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:2%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\"><B><I>Battery Pack </I></B></FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">We have designed our battery packs to have a life of over 100,000 miles or seven years. In addition, we have designed battery packs to be modular so that we can leverage technology developments across our different vehicles and products. For example, the Tesla Roadster battery pack contains 6,831 lithium-ion cells, each similar to the 6 to 12 cells (made by third party lithium-ion cell providers) found in many standard laptop computers. The battery pack contains 53 kilowatt-hours of usable energy, almost double the energy of any other commercially available electric vehicle battery pack, thereby significantly increasing vehicle range capability. Designing an electric powertrain and a vehicle to exploit its energy efficiency has required extensive safety testing and innovation in battery packs, motors, powertrain systems and vehicle engineering. Our proprietary technology includes cooling systems, safety systems, charge balancing systems, battery engineering for vibration and environmental durability, robotic manufacturing processes, customized motor design and the software and electronics management systems necessary to manage battery and vehicle performance under demanding real-life driving conditions. We have significant experience and expertise in the safety and management systems needed to work with lithium-ion cells in the demanding automotive environment. We believe these advancements have enabled us to produce a battery pack at a low cost per kilowatt-hour. To date, our customers have driven the Tesla Roadster for an estimated aggregate of over 9.0&nbsp;million miles. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">We believe one of our core competencies is the design of our complete battery pack system. We have designed our battery pack system to permit flexibility with respect to battery cell chemistry, form factor and vendor that we adopt for battery cell supply. In so doing, we believe that we can leverage the substantial battery </FONT></P> <p STYLE=\"margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px\"><FONT SIZE=\"1\">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px\" ALIGN=\"center\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">10 </FONT></P> <p Style='page-break-before:always'> <HR SIZE=\"3\" style=\"COLOR:#999999\" WIDTH=\"100%\" ALIGN=\"CENTER\"> <h5 align=\"left\"><a href=\"#toc\">Table of Contents</a></h5> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\"> cell investments and advancements being made globally by battery cell manufacturers to continue to improve the cost per kilowatt-hour of our battery pack. We maintain an internal battery cell testing lab and an extensive performance database of the many available lithium-ion cell vendors and chemistry types. We intend to incorporate the battery cells that provide the best value and performance possible into our battery packs, and we expect this to continue over time as battery cells continue to improve in energy storage capacity, longevity, power delivery and cost. We believe this flexibility will enable us to continue to evaluate new battery cells as they become commercially viable, and thereby optimize battery pack system performance and cost for our current and future vehicles. We believe our ability to change battery cell chemistries and vendors while retaining our existing investments in software, electronics, testing and vehicle packaging, will enable us to quickly deploy various battery cells into our products and leverage the latest advancements in battery cell technology. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">The range of our electric vehicles on a single charge declines principally as a function of usage, time and charging patterns. For example, a customer&#146;s use of their Tesla vehicle as well as the frequency with which they charge the battery of their Tesla vehicle can result in additional deterioration of the battery&#146;s ability to hold a charge. We currently expect that the Tesla Roadster battery pack will retain approximately 60-65% of its ability to hold its initial charge after approximately 100,000 miles or seven years, which will result in a decrease to the vehicle&#146;s initial range. In addition, based on internal testing, we estimate that our Tesla Roadster would have a 5-10% reduction in range when operated in -20&deg;C temperatures. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">To date, we have tested hundreds of battery cells of different chemistries, form factors and designs. Based on this evaluation, we are presently using lithium-ion battery cells based on the 18650 form factor in all of our battery packs. These battery cells are commercially available in large quantities. We currently intend to use the same battery cell form factor in the Model&nbsp;S. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:2%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\"><B><I>Power Electronics </I></B></FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">The power electronics in Tesla&#146;s electric powertrains govern the flow of electrical current throughout the car, primarily the current that flows into and out of the battery pack. The power electronics has two primary functions, the control of torque generation in the motor while driving and the control of energy delivery back into the battery pack while charging. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">The first function is accomplished through the drive inverter, which converts direct current (DC) from the battery pack into alternating current (AC) to drive our three-phase induction motors. The drive inverter also converts the AC generated by regenerative braking back into DC for electrical storage in the battery pack. The drive inverter performs this function by using a high-performance digital signal processor which runs some of the most complicated and detailed software in the vehicle. In so doing, the drive inverter is directly responsible for the performance, high efficiency and overall driving experience of the vehicle. For example, the power electronics in the 2010 Tesla Roadster Sport is capable of delivering approximately 900 amps of electrical current in a matter of milliseconds, enabling the rapid acceleration of the vehicle. We are continuing to make advancements in the drive inverter. The Model S drive inverter, for example, will be able to deliver approximately 1,000 amps of current at better efficiency and lower cost as compared to the Tesla Roadster drive inverter. In addition, we are also designing the drive inverter to integrate more directly with other components of the powertrain, reducing cost and size while improving packaging efficiency. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">The second function, charging the battery pack, is accomplished by the charger, which converts alternating current (usually from a wall outlet or other electricity source) into direct current which can be accepted by the battery. The charger enables us to use any available source of power to charge our vehicle. Our vehicles can recharge on any electrical outlet from a common outlet of 15 amps and 120 volts all the way up to a high power outlet of 70 amps and 240 volts, which provides optimal recharging. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">Since the Tesla Roadster charger system is built into the vehicle, it is possible to charge the vehicle using a variety of power outlets.

A high power connection capable of 240 volts and 70 amps reduces this charging time to about 4.5 hours. Such a connection can be installed in many homes with the assistance of a qualified electrician. For additional flexibility, the Tesla Roadster battery pack can also be charged with a 120 volt, 15 amp connection. Using this lower power output, the Tesla Roadster battery pack can be charged to full capacity in about 42 hours. This flexibility in charging provides customers with additional mobility, while also allowing them to conveniently charge the vehicle overnight at home. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">For the Model&nbsp;S, we plan to offer a high-voltage fast charge option that will enable the vehicle to charge from higher amperage, DC commercial charging stations that we anticipate may be available in the future. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:2%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\"><B><I>Motor </I></B></FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">Our powertrains currently use custom designed 3-phase induction motors. We believe we have made several important innovations in our motor design that minimize mass while still providing high power and efficiency. Our motors incorporate a proprietary fabricated copper rotor design. Our motors also include optimized winding patterns that allow for easy manufacture and fit in as much copper as possible to reduce resistance and energy losses. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">We also use high-quality bearings and precision balancing on the rotor and shaft to enable the spin of the motor up to 13,000 revolutions per minute, or rpm, in normal operation. Combining this very high rpm rating with an instantaneous stall torque of over 200 foot pounds gives a broad torque-speed map that allows a single speed gearbox to deliver high vehicle performance. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:2%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\"><B><I>Gearbox </I></B></FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">We have designed a custom, single speed gearbox that is manufactured in-house for the Tesla Roadster. The Roadster gearbox combines low mass with high efficiency and can match both the speed and torque capabilities of Tesla&#146;s AC induction motors. In comparison to a gasoline-powered vehicle, the elimination of gear changes contributes to the rapid acceleration characteristics of the Tesla Roadster. We plan to design and manufacture the gearbox for the upcoming Model S sedan. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:2%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\"><B><I>Control Software </I></B></FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">The performance and safety systems of the Tesla Roadster and its battery required the development of sophisticated control software. There are numerous processors in the Tesla Roadster to control these functions, and we write custom firmware for many of these processors. The flow of electricity between the battery pack and the motor must be tightly controlled in order to deliver the performance and behavior expected in the vehicle. For example, software algorithms enable the vehicle to mimic the &#147;creep&#148; feeling which drivers expect from an internal combustion engine vehicle without having to apply pressure on the accelerator. Similar algorithms control traction, vehicle stability and the sustained acceleration and regenerative braking of the vehicle. Drivers use the information systems in the Tesla Roadster to optimize performance and charging modes and times. Software also is used extensively to monitor the charge state of each of the cells of the battery pack and to manage all of its safety systems. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">We plan to leverage our investment in software for the development of the Model&nbsp;S.

We design and engineer bodies, chassis, interiors, heating and cooling and low voltage electrical systems in house and to a lesser extent in conjunction with our suppliers. Our team has core competencies in computer aided design and crash test simulations which we expect to reduce the product development time of new models. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">Several traditional automotive subsystems required substantial redesign and custom optimization to integrate with the powertrain of an electric vehicle. For example, we redesigned the heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system to integrate with the battery thermal management system and to operate without the energy generated from an internal combustion engine. In addition, low voltage electric systems which power features such as the radio, power windows, and heated seats also needed to be designed specifically for use in an electric vehicle. We have developed expertise in integrating these components with the high-voltage power source in the vehicle and in designing components that significantly reduce their load on the vehicle battery pack, thereby maximizing the available range of the vehicle. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">Additionally, our team has expertise in lightweight materials, a very important characteristic for electric vehicles given the impact of mass on range. The Tesla Roadster is built with an internally-designed carbon fiber body which provides a balance of strength and mass. We intend to build the Model&nbsp;S with a lightweight aluminum body and have been designing the body and chassis with a variety of materials and production methods that will help optimize the weight of the vehicle. We intend to develop a substantially integrated electric vehicle manufacturing facility in Fremont, California to assemble vehicles and manufacture components that are critical to our intellectual property and quality of the Model&nbsp;S. Our engineering and manufacturing teams are working alongside one another in an effort to accelerate the Model&nbsp;S development. We believe the co-location of our engineering and manufacturing teams will help accelerate the development of new products and allow for faster introduction of product changes. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">As of December&nbsp;31, 2010, we had 170 employees in our vehicle design and engineering departments. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\"><B>Sales and Marketing </B></FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:2%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\"><B><I>Company-Owned Sales </I></B></FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">We market and sell cars directly to consumers. Until we opened our first store in Los Angeles, California in May 2008, all of our sales of the Tesla Roadster were conducted via the phone and internet, or in-person at our headquarters and corporate events. Increasingly, sales are being made through our network of Tesla stores. Our Tesla stores are highly visible, premium outlets in major metropolitan markets that generally combine retail sales and service. We intend to build separate sales and service locations in several markets. As of December&nbsp;31, 2008, we had opened 2 stores, which increased to 10 stores by December&nbsp;31, 2009 and 16 stores by December&nbsp;31, 2010. As of February&nbsp;28, 2011, we had opened 17 Tesla stores in the United States, Europe and Asia, located in Boulder, Chicago, Los Angeles, Menlo Park, Miami, New York, Newport Beach, Seattle, Washington, D.C., Copenhagen, London, Milan, Monaco, Munich, Paris, Tokyo and Zurich. We plan to open additional stores during 2011, with a goal of establishing approximately 50 stores globally within the next several years in connection with the planned Model&nbsp;S rollout. Additionally, we plan to introduce a new store concept in 2011 to enhance the customer purchasing experience and to generate greater visibility for Tesla products in areas of high customer foot traffic. We also anticipate that we will place greater sales emphasis on the generation of Model S reservations during 2011.

While some customers purchase their vehicles from this inventory, most of our Tesla Roadster customers choose to customize the appearance of their vehicle. Potential customers who purchase Tesla Roadsters manufactured to specification are required to enter into a purchase agreement and pay a nonrefundable deposit, which is applied towards the purchase price of the vehicle. For vehicles purchased directly from our showrooms, no deposit is required. For our 2011 model year Tesla Roadsters manufactured to specification, our current purchase agreement requires the payment of an initial deposit, which varies based on the country of purchase. For the Model&nbsp;S, we require an initial refundable reservation payment of at least $5,000. Prior to 2010, our reservation policy was to accept refundable reservation payments from all customers who wished to purchase a Tesla Roadster and require full payment of the purchase price of the vehicle at the time the customer selected their vehicle specifications. During the second quarter of 2010, we changed our policy to require nonrefundable deposits for Tesla Roadsters manufactured to specification. We also occasionally accept refundable reservation payments if a customer is interested in purchasing a vehicle but not yet prepared to select the vehicle specifications. We currently require full payment of the purchase price of the vehicle only upon delivery of the vehicle to the customer. Reservation payments and deposits are used by us to fund, in part, our working capital requirements and help us to align production with demand. For customers who have placed a refundable reservation payment with us, the reservation payment becomes a nonrefundable deposit once the customer has selected the vehicle specifications and enters into a purchase agreement. The drivable early prototype of the Model&nbsp;S was exhibited to the public in March 2009 and as of December&nbsp;31, 2010, we had received approximately 3,400 customer reservations for the vehicle. As of December&nbsp;31, 2010, we held reservation payments for undelivered Tesla Roadsters in an aggregate of $2.5&nbsp;million and reservation payments for Model S sedans in an aggregate of $28.3&nbsp;million.

The initial body and chassis assembly processes for our Tesla Roadster occur at a Lotus Cars Limited (Lotus) facility in Hethel, England where our staff works closely with Lotus. For vehicles destined for the United States, we ship the rolling chassis, which does not contain our electric powertrain and which we call a glider, to our final assembly facility in Menlo Park, California. At our Menlo Park location, we install the full electric vehicle powertrain and perform a pre-delivery inspection prior to shipping the Tesla Roadster to customers. For European and Asian deliveries, the full vehicle is assembled on-line at the Lotus facility and pre-delivery inspection occurs at a nearby Tesla facility in Wymondham, England. Pursuant to the supply agreement with Lotus, we are obligated to purchase a minimum of 2,400 vehicles or gliders over the term of the agreement. We currently intend to manufacture gliders with Lotus for our current generation Tesla Roadster until January 2012. We intend to use these gliders in the manufacturing of the Tesla Roadster to both fulfill orders placed in 2011 as well as new orders placed in 2012 until our supply of gliders is exhausted. Accordingly, we intend to offer a limited number of Tesla Roadsters for sale in 2012. To the extent we wish to sell additional Tesla Roadsters with the Lotus gliders beyond those we have contracted for, we will need to negotiate a new or amended supply agreement with Lotus.

We have developed close relationships with several key suppliers particularly in the procurement of cells and certain electric powertrain components. While we obtain components from multiple sources whenever possible, similar to other automobile manufacturers, many of the components used in our vehicles are purchased by us from a single source. We refer to these component suppliers as our single source suppliers. To date, we have not qualified alternative sources for most of the single sourced components used in our vehicles and we generally do not maintain long-term agreements with our single source suppliers. For example, while several sources of the battery cell we have selected for the Tesla Roadster, Daimler Smart fortwo and Daimler A-Class are available, we have fully qualified only one supplier for these cells. Any disruption in the supply of battery cells from such vendor could temporarily disrupt production of the vehicles until such time as a different supplier is fully qualified and there can be no assurance that we would be able to successfully retain alternative suppliers on a timely basis. Moreover, battery cell manufactures may choose to refuse to supply electric vehicle manufacturers to the extent they determine that the vehicles are not sufficiently safe. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">While we believe that we may be able to establish alternate supply relationships and can obtain or engineer replacement components for our single source components, we may be unable to do so in the short term or at all at prices or costs that are favorable to us. In particular, while we believe that we will be able to secure alternate sources of supply for almost all of our single sourced components on a relatively short time frame, qualifying alternate suppliers or developing our own replacements for certain highly customized components of the Tesla Roadster, such as the carbon fiber body panels, which are supplied to us by Sotira 35, a unit of Sora Composites Group. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">In addition, Lotus is the only manufacturer for certain components, such as the chassis of our Tesla Roadster, and we refer to it as a sole source supplier. We do not currently utilize any sole source suppliers other than Lotus. Replacing the components from Lotus that are sole sourced may require us to reengineer our vehicles, which would be time consuming and costly. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">We are currently designing and sourcing components for the Model S that will leverage world-class automotive suppliers.&nbsp;We plan to leverage our relationships with Daimler and Toyota to access their supply bases and gain access to some low cost, high quality parts. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">We use various raw materials in our business including aluminum, steel, carbon fiber, non-ferrous metals such as copper, as well as nickel and cobalt.

For vehicles destined for the United States, we ship the glider to our final assembly facility in Menlo Park, California. For European and Asian deliveries, the full vehicle is assembled on-line at the Lotus facility and pre-delivery inspection occurs at a Tesla facility in Wymondham, England. Pursuant to the supply agreement with Lotus, we are obligated to purchase a minimum of 2,400 vehicles or gliders over the term of the agreement. If we are unable to meet this volume requirement, we are still responsible for payment to Lotus of the lesser of the sum of the actual costs incurred and an agreed upon profit margin per vehicle up to the minimum volume requirement or &pound;5,400,000. We currently intend to manufacture gliders with Lotus for our current generation Tesla Roadster until January 2012. We intend to use these gliders in the manufacturing of the Tesla Roadster to both fulfill orders placed in 2011 as well as new orders placed in 2012 until our supply of gliders is exhausted. Accordingly, we intend to offer a limited number of Tesla Roadsters for sale in 2012. To the extent we wish to sell additional Tesla Roadsters with the Lotus gliders beyond those we have contracted for, we will need to negotiate a new or amended supply agreement with Lotus. As of December&nbsp;31, 2010, we had purchased approximately 1,700 vehicles or gliders under this agreement. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\"><B>Governmental Programs, Incentives and Regulations </B></FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:2%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\"><B><I>United States Department of Energy Loans </I></B></FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">On January&nbsp;20, 2010, we entered into a loan facility with the Federal Financing Bank (FFB) and the United States Department of Energy (DOE), under the DOE&#146;s Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program, as set forth in Section&nbsp;136 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (ATVM Program). We refer to such loan facility as the DOE Loan Facility. Under the DOE Loan Facility, FFB has made available to us two multi-draw term loan facilities in an aggregate principal amount of up to $465.0&nbsp;million and the DOE has agreed to reimburse FFB for any liabilities, losses, costs or expenses incurred by FFB with respect to the term loan facilities. Up to an aggregate principal amount of $101.2&nbsp;million will be made available under the first term loan facility to finance up to 80% of the costs eligible for funding under the ATVM Program for the powertrain engineering and the build-out of a facility to design and manufacture lithium-ion battery packs, electric motors and electric components (the Powertrain Facility). Up to an aggregate principal amount of $363.9&nbsp;million will be made available under the second term loan facility to finance up to 80% of the costs eligible for funding under the ATVM Program for the development of, and to build out the manufacturing facility for, our Model&nbsp;S sedan (the Model&nbsp;S Facility). Under the DOE Loan Facility, we are responsible for the remaining 20% of the costs eligible for funding under the ATVM Program for the projects as well as any cost overruns for each project. The costs paid by us to date for the Powertrain Facility and the Model&nbsp;S Facility will be applied towards our obligation to contribute 20% of the eligible project costs, and the DOE&#146;s funding of future eligible costs will be adjusted to take this into account.

For the Powertrain Facility, the draw conditions include our achievement of progress milestones relating to the development of the powertrain manufacturing facility and the successful development of commercial arrangements with third parties for the supply of powertrain components. For the Model&nbsp;S Facility, the draw conditions include our achievement of progress milestones relating to the design and development of the Model&nbsp;S and the planned Model&nbsp;S manufacturing facility. We will be required to maintain, at all times, available cash and cash equivalents of at least 105% of the amounts required to fund such commitment, after taking into account current cash flows and cash on hand, and reasonable projections of future generation of net cash from operations, losses and expenditures. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">Loans may be requested under the facilities until January&nbsp;22, 2013, and we have committed to complete the projects being financed prior to such date. On the closing date, we paid a facility fee to the DOE in the amount of $0.5 million. Through December&nbsp;31, 2010, we have received draw downs under the DOE Loan Facility for an aggregate of $71.8 million, with interest rates ranging from 1.7% to 3.4%, for eligible project costs under both projects that we have incurred from December&nbsp;15, 2008 through October&nbsp;31, 2010. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">Advances under the DOE Loan Facility accrue interest at a per annum rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury as of the date of the advance, and will be based on the Treasury yield curve and the scheduled principal installments for such advance. Interest on advances under the DOE Loan Facility is payable quarterly in arrears. Advances under the Powertrain Facility are repayable in 28 equal quarterly installments commencing on December&nbsp;15, 2012 (or, for advances made after such date, in 26 equal quarterly installments commencing on June&nbsp;15, 2013). All outstanding amounts under the Powertrain Facility will be due and payable on the maturity date of September&nbsp;15, 2019.

All outstanding amounts under the Model&nbsp;S Facility will be due and payable on the maturity date of September&nbsp;15, 2022. Advances under the loan facilities may be voluntarily prepaid at any time at a price determined based on interest rates at the time of prepayment for loans made from the Secretary of the Treasury to FFB for obligations with an identical payment schedule to the advance being prepaid, which could result in the advance being prepaid at a discount, at par or at a premium.

Under the DOE Loan Facility, we are required to fund a debt service reserve account on or before December&nbsp;31, 2012, in an amount equal to all principal and interest that will come due on the advances on the next two payment dates. Once we have deposited such two payments, we will not be required to further fund such debt service reserve account. We have also agreed that in connection with the sale of our stock in any follow-on equity offering, at least 50% of the net offering proceeds will be received by us. Offering proceeds may not be used to pay bonuses or other compensation to officers, directors, employees or consultants in excess of the amounts contemplated by our business plan approved by the DOE.

This dedicated account can be used by us to fund any cost overruns for our powertrain and Model&nbsp;S manufacturing facility projects and will also be used as a mechanism to defer advances under the DOE Loan Facility. This will not affect our ability to draw down the full amount of the DOE loans, but will require us to use the dedicated account to fund certain project costs up front, which costs may then be reimbursed by loans under the DOE Loan Facility once the dedicated account is depleted, or as part of the final advance for the applicable project. We will be required to deposit a portion of these reimbursements into the dedicated account, in an amount equal to up to 30% of the remaining project costs for the applicable project and these amounts may similarly be used by us to fund project costs and cost overruns and will similarly be eligible for reimbursement by the draw down of additional loans under our DOE Loan Facility once used in full. As of December&nbsp;31, 2010, we have $73.6 million remaining in the dedicated account. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">The DOE Loan Facility documents contain customary events of default, subject in some cases to customary cure periods for certain defaults. Events of default include, among others, non-payment defaults, inaccuracy of representations and warranties, covenant defaults, defaults under or termination of our leases for the projects, a default in the event of a change of control, including a failure of Elon Musk, our Chief Executive Officer, Product Architect and Chairman, and certain of his affiliates, at any time prior to one year after we complete the project relating to the Model&nbsp;S Facility, to own at least 65% of capital stock held by Mr.&nbsp;Musk and such affiliates as of the date of the DOE Loan Facility, cross-defaults to certain other material indebtedness, failure to timely complete the projects, material judgment defaults, bankruptcy and insolvency defaults and force majeure events with respect to the projects. The occurrence of an event of default could result in an acceleration of all obligations under the DOE Loan Facility documents, an obligation by us and any guarantor to repay all obligations in full, and the exercise of remedies by the DOE or their agent. Our failure to make a timely payment could result in an increase to the applicable interest rate. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">In connection with the DOE Loan Facility, we have also issued the DOE a warrant to purchase up to 3,085,011 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $7.54 per share and a warrant to purchase up to 5,100 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $8.94 per share. Beginning on December&nbsp;15, 2018 and until December&nbsp;14, 2022, the shares subject to purchase under these warrants will become exercisable in quarterly amounts depending on the average outstanding balance of the loan during the prior quarter. These warrants may be exercised until December&nbsp;15, 2023. If we prepay the DOE Loan Facility in full prior to December&nbsp;15, 2018, no shares will be exercisable under these warrants, except in the case of an event of default, which could accelerate the vesting. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:2%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\"><B><I>California Alternative Energy and Advanced Transportation Financing Authority Tax Incentives </I></B></FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">In December 2009, we finalized an arrangement with the California Alternative Energy and Advanced Transportation Financing Authority that will result in an exemption from California state sales and use taxes for up to $320&nbsp;million of manufacturing equipment.

Under California&#146;s Low-Emission Vehicle Regulations, and similar laws in other states, vehicle manufacturers are required to ensure that a portion of the vehicles delivered for sale in that state during each model year are zero emission vehicles. Currently, the states of California, Connecticut, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island and Vermont have such laws in effect. These laws provide that a manufacturer of zero emission vehicles may earn credits, referred to as ZEV credits, and may sell excess credits to other manufacturers who apply such credits to comply with these regulatory requirements. As a manufacturer solely of zero emission vehicles, we earn ZEV credits on each vehicle sold in such states and have entered into agreements with other automobile manufacturers to sell the ZEV credits that we earn. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">We have entered into two contracts for the sale of ZEV credits with two separate automotive manufacturers.

Our current agreement with American Honda Co., Inc. (Honda) provides for the sale of ZEV credits that we earn from the sale of vehicles that we manufacture through December&nbsp;31, 2011. As of December&nbsp;31, 2010, we had sold credits for 491 vehicles under this agreement and Honda has an obligation to purchase credits for up to 150 additional vehicles that Tesla will manufacture prior to the expiration of the agreement. To the extent we have additional ZEV credits available for sale, we may enter into new agreements with Honda or other manufacturers to sell such credits.

Those FMVSSs generally allow low volume manufacturers (those who manufacture fewer than 5,000 vehicles annually for sale in the United States) and limited line manufacturers (those who sell three or fewer vehicle lines in the United States) to defer compliance until the end of the phase-in period. We currently qualify as both a low volume manufacturer and a limited line manufacturer, and as a result, we are currently exempt from certain requirements, such as some new advanced airbag requirements, the advanced side impact requirements, and certain electronic stability control requirements, until the end of the applicable phase-in periods. In addition, we have applied for, and have been granted, an exemption from certain other advanced air bag requirements, which applies to Tesla Roadsters manufactured through January&nbsp;28, 2011. We have filed a request for an extension of such exemption for Tesla Roadsters manufactured after such date. While that application is pending and under consideration by NHTSA, the existing exemption is automatically extended. Under U.S. law, we are required to certify compliance with, or obtain exemption from, all applicable federal motor vehicle safety standards and we have done so with respect to each vehicle we have offered for sale in the United States. Based on testing, engineering analysis, and other information, we have certified that the Tesla Roadster complies with, or is exempt from all applicable NHTSA standards by affixing a certification label to each Tesla Roadster sold. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">We are also required to comply with other NHTSA requirements of federal laws administered by NHTSA, including the Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards, consumer information labeling requirements, early warning reporting requirements regarding warranty claims, field reports, death and injury reports and foreign recalls, and owner&#146;s manual requirements. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">Our vehicles sold in Europe are subject to European Union safety testing regulations. Many of those regulations, referred to as European Union Whole Vehicle Type Approval (WVTA), are different from the federal motor vehicle safety standards applicable in the United States and may require redesign and/or retesting. Our Tesla Roadsters are currently approved for sale on a limited basis in the European Union via the Small Series&nbsp;WVTA, which permits the manufacture and sale in the European Union of no more than 1,000 vehicles per year. We plan to keep European sales of our Tesla Roadsters at less than 1,000 vehicles per year, and have no plans to commence testing our Tesla Roadsters for the WVTA to assure compliance with the European Union requirements to permit unlimited sales. Similarly, Australia and Japan have additional testing regulations applicable to high volume manufacturers. We also plan to keep Australian and Japanese sales of our Tesla Roadsters at a low volume, and have no plans to comply with the Australian and Japanese requirements to permit high volume sales in these jurisdictions. In connection with the planned introduction of the Tesla Roadster in Australia and Japan, we conducted a frontal impact test based on European Union testing standards on the Tesla Roadster in November 2009, which is required for sales exceeding certain annual volumes outside the United States. While the Tesla Roadster met most of the criteria for occupant protection and all criteria for high voltage safety in the front impact crash test, there were two criteria that were not met in the test. Based on our analysis of additional compliance options in Australia and Japan, we believe such an outcome should not limit our ability to sell the Tesla Roadster in Australia below certain annual volumes or, subject to compliance with certain Japanese import rules, have a material impact on our ability to sell Tesla Roadsters in Japan. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) requires us to calculate and display the range of our electric vehicles on a label we affix to the vehicle&#146;s window. The FTC specifies that we follow testing requirements set forth by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) which further requires that we test using the United States EPA&#146;s combined city and highway testing cycles. The EPA announced in November 2009 that it would develop and establish new energy efficiency testing methodologies for electric vehicles. Based on initial indications from the EPA, we believe it is likely that the EPA will modify its testing cycles in a manner that, when applied to our vehicles, could reduce the advertised range of our vehicles by up to 30% as compared to the combined two-cycle test currently applicable to our vehicles. However, there can be no assurance that the modified EPA testing cycles will not result in a greater reduction.

The Certificate of Conformity is required for vehicles sold in states covered by the Clean Air Act&#146;s standards and both the Certificate of Conformity and the Executive Order is required for vehicles sold in states that have sought and received a waiver from the EPA to utilize California standards. The California standards for emissions control for certain regulated pollutants for new vehicles and engines sold in California are set by CARB.

We received a Certificate of Conformity for sales of our Tesla Roadsters in 2008 and 2010, but did not receive a Certificate of Conformity for sales of the Tesla Roadster in 2009 until December&nbsp;21, 2009.

We reported the failure to obtain a Certificate of Conformity for 2009 to the EPA on December&nbsp;20, 2009. In January 2010, we and the EPA entered into an Administrative Settlement Agreement and Audit Policy Determination in which we agreed to pay a civil administrative penalty in the sum of $275,000. The EPA agreed to treat any 2009 Tesla Roadsters sold prior to December&nbsp;21, 2009 as if they were covered by a valid Certificate of Conformity based on our agreement to treat these vehicles as if they had been certified when sold for emissions and emissions warranty purposes. The EPA has closed the matter and we have been notified that it considers the violations resolved as of January 2010. All Tesla Roadsters we sold prior to obtaining the Certificate of Conformity in 2009 are now considered lawfully sold for purposes of the Clean Air Act with no impediments to further registration, use or subsequent sale. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:2%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\"><B><I>Regulation&#151;Battery Safety and Testing </I></B></FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">Our battery pack conforms with mandatory regulations that govern transport of &#147;dangerous goods&#148; that may present a risk in transportation, which includes lithium-ion batteries.

We are registered as both a motor vehicle manufacturer and dealer in the states of California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois and Washington, and we are licensed as a motor vehicle dealer in the state of New York. We are similarly licensed in the District of Columbia as an EV retail store. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">To the extent possible, we plan to secure dealer licenses (or the equivalent of a dealer license) and engage in activities as a motor vehicle dealer in other states as appropriate and necessary as we open additional Tesla stores. Some states, such as Texas, do not permit automobile manufacturers to be licensed as dealers or to act in the capacity of a dealer. To sell vehicles to residents of states where we are not licensed as a dealer, to the extent permitted by local law, both the actual sale and all activities related to the sale would generally have to occur out of state. In this scenario, it is possible that activities related to marketing, advertising, taking orders, taking reservations and reservation payments, and delivering vehicles could be viewed by a state as conducting unlicensed activities in the state or otherwise violating the state&#146;s motor vehicle industry laws. Regulators in these states may require us to hold and meet the requirements of appropriate dealer or other licenses and, in states in which manufacturers are prohibited from acting as dealers, may otherwise prohibit or impact our planned activities. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">In jurisdictions where we do not have a Tesla store, a customer may try to purchase our vehicles over the internet. However, some states, such as Kansas, have laws providing that a manufacturer cannot deliver a vehicle to a resident of such state except through a dealer licensed to do business in that state which may be interpreted to require us to open a store in the state of Kansas in order to sell vehicles to Kansas residents. Such laws may be interpreted to require us to open a store in such state before we sell vehicles to residents of such states. In some states where we have opened a viewing &#147;gallery&#148; that is not a full retail location, it is possible that a state regulator could take the position that activities at our gallery constitute an unlicensed motor vehicle dealership and thereby violates applicable manufacturer-dealer laws. For example, the state of Colorado required us to obtain dealer and manufacturer licenses in the state in order to operate our gallery in Colorado. Although we would prefer that a state regulator address any concerns of this nature by discussing such concerns with us and requesting voluntary compliance, a state could also take action against us, including levying fines or requiring that we refrain from certain activities at that location. In addition, some states have requirements that service facilities be available with respect to vehicles sold in the state, which may be interpreted to also require that service facilities be available with respect to vehicles sold over the internet to residents of the state thereby limiting our ability to sell vehicles in states where we do not maintain service facilities. </FONT></P> <p STYLE=\"margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px\"><FONT SIZE=\"1\">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px\" ALIGN=\"center\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">26 </FONT></P> <p Style='page-break-before:always'> <HR SIZE=\"3\" style=\"COLOR:#999999\" WIDTH=\"100%\" ALIGN=\"CENTER\"> <h5 align=\"left\"><a href=\"#toc\">Table of Contents</a></h5> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">The foregoing examples of state laws governing the sale of motor vehicles are just some of the regulations we will face as we sell our vehicles. In many states, the application of state motor vehicle laws to our specific sales model is largely without precedent, particularly with respect to sales over the internet, and would be determined by a fact specific analysis of numerous factors, including whether we have a physical presence or employees in the applicable state, whether we advertise or conduct other activities in the applicable state, how the sale transaction is structured, the volume of sales into the state, and whether the state in question prohibits manufacturers from acting as dealers. As a result of the fact specific and untested nature of these issues, and the fact that applying these laws intended for the traditional automobile distribution model to our sales model allows for some interpretation and discretion by the regulators, state legal prohibitions may prevent us from selling to consumers in such state. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">California laws, and potentially the laws of other states, restrict the ability of licensed dealers to advertise or take deposits for vehicles before they are available. In November 2007, we became aware that the New Motor Vehicle Board of the California Department of Transportation has considered whether our reservation and advertising policies comply with these laws. To date, we have not received any communications on this topic from the New Motor Vehicle Board or the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) which has the power to enforce these laws. There can be no assurance that the DMV will not take the position that our vehicle reservation or advertising practices violate the law. We expect that if the DMV determines that we may have violated the law, it would initially discuss its concerns with us and request voluntary compliance. If we are ultimately found to be in violation of California law, we might be precluded from taking reservation payments, and the DMV could take other actions against us, including levying fines and requiring us to refund reservation payments. Resolution of any inquiry may also involve restructuring certain aspects of the reservation program. The DMV also has the power to suspend licenses to manufacture and sell vehicles in California, following a hearing on the merits, which it has typically exercised only in cases of significant or repeat violations and/or a refusal to comply with DMV directions. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">Certain states may have specific laws which apply to dealers, or manufacturers selling directly to consumers, or both. For example, the state of Washington requires that reservation payments or other payment received from residents in the state of Washington must be placed in a segregated account until delivery of the vehicle, which account must be unencumbered by any liens from creditors of the dealer and may not be used by the dealer. Consequently, we established a segregated account for reservation payments in the state of Washington in January 2010. There can be no assurance that other state or foreign jurisdictions will not require similar segregation of reservation payment received from customers. Our inability to access these funds for working capital purposes could harm our liquidity. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">Furthermore, while we have performed an analysis of the principal laws in the European Union relating to our distribution model and believe we comply with such laws, we have not performed a complete analysis in all foreign jurisdictions in which we may sell vehicles. Accordingly, there may be laws in jurisdictions we have not yet entered or laws we are unaware of in jurisdictions we have entered that may restrict our vehicle reservation practices or other business practices. Even for those jurisdictions we have analyzed, the laws in this area can be complex, difficult to interpret and may change over time. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">In addition to licensing laws, specific laws and regulations in each of the states (and their interpretation by regulators) may limit or determine how we sell, market, advertise, and otherwise solicit sales, take orders, take reservations and reservation payments, deliver, and service vehicles for consumers and engage in other activities in that state. While we have performed an analysis of laws in certain jurisdictions in which we have Tesla stores, we have not performed a complete analysis in all jurisdictions in which we may sell vehicles. Accordingly, there may be laws in jurisdictions we have not yet entered that may restrict our vehicle reservation practices or other business practices. </FONT></P> <p STYLE=\"margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px\"><FONT SIZE=\"1\">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px\" ALIGN=\"center\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">27 </FONT></P> <p Style='page-break-before:always'> <HR SIZE=\"3\" style=\"COLOR:#999999\" WIDTH=\"100%\" ALIGN=\"CENTER\"> <h5 align=\"left\"><a href=\"#toc\">Table of Contents</a></h5> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\"><B>Competition </B></FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">Competition in the automotive industry is intense and evolving.

In Japan, Mitsubishi has been selling its electric iMiEV since April 2010. We expect additional competitors to enter the United States and Europe within the next several years, and as they do so, we expect that we will experience significant competition. With respect to our Tesla Roadster, we currently face strong competition from established automobile manufacturers, including manufacturers of high-performance vehicles, such as Porsche and Ferrari. In addition, upon the launch of our Model&nbsp;S sedan, we will face competition from existing and future automobile manufacturers in the extremely competitive luxury sedan market, including Audi, BMW, Lexus and Mercedes. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">Many established and new automobile manufacturers have entered or have announced plans to enter the alternative fuel vehicle market.

In addition, several manufacturers, including General Motors, Toyota, Ford, and Honda are each selling hybrid vehicles, and certain </FONT></P> <p STYLE=\"margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px\"><FONT SIZE=\"1\">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px\" ALIGN=\"center\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">28 </FONT></P> <p Style='page-break-before:always'> <HR SIZE=\"3\" style=\"COLOR:#999999\" WIDTH=\"100%\" ALIGN=\"CENTER\"> <h5 align=\"left\"><a href=\"#toc\">Table of Contents</a></h5> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\"> of these manufacturers have announced plug-in versions of their hybrid vehicles. For example, in December 2010, General Motors introduced the Chevrolet Volt, which is a plug-in hybrid vehicle that operates purely on electric power for a limited number of miles, at which time an internal combustion engine engages to recharge the battery. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">Moreover, it has been reported that BMW, Daimler, Lexus, Audi, Renault and Volkswagen are also developing electric vehicles. Several new start-ups have also announced plans to enter the market for performance electric vehicles, although none of these have yet come to market. Finally, electric vehicles have already been brought to market in China and other foreign countries and we expect a number of those manufacturers to enter the United States market as well. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">Most of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing and other resources than we do and may be able to devote greater resources to the design, development, manufacturing, distribution, promotion, sale and support of their products. Virtually all of our competitors have more extensive customer bases and broader customer and industry relationships than we do. In addition, almost all of these companies have longer operating histories and greater name recognition than we do. Our competitors may be in a stronger position to respond quickly to new technologies and may be able to design, develop, market and sell their products more effectively. We believe our exclusive focus on electric vehicles and electric vehicle components, as well as our history of vehicle development and production, are the basis on which we can compete in the global automotive market in spite of the challenges posed by our competition; however, we have a limited history of operations. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\"><B>Intellectual Property </B></FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">Our success depends, at least in part, on our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of patents, patent applications, trade secrets, including know-how, employee and third party nondisclosure agreements, copyright laws, trademarks, intellectual property licenses and other contractual rights to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our technology. As of February&nbsp;3, 2011, we had 35 issued patents and approximately 280 pending patent applications with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and internationally in a broad range of areas. Our issued patents start expiring in 2026. We intend to continue to file additional patent applications with respect to our technology. We do not know whether any of our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents or whether the examination process will require us to narrow our claims. Even if granted, there can be no assurance that these pending patent applications will provide us with protection. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\"><B>Employees </B></FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">As of December&nbsp;31, 2010, we had 899 full-time employees consisting of 213 in manufacturing, 212 in powertrain research and development, 121 in sales and marketing, 170 in vehicle design and engineering, 79 in service and 104 in general and administration. Of all of our employees, 648 are located in our Northern California offices, 106 are located at our Los Angeles facility and 51 are located at our United Kingdom offices. The other employees are located in other international locations. None of our employees are currently represented by labor unions or are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with respect to their employment. To date, we have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good. </FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\"><B>Additional Information </B></FONT></P> <P STYLE=\"margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%\"><FONT STYLE=\"font-family:Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"2\">We file or furnish periodic reports, including our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current reports on Form 8-K; proxy statements and other information with the SEC.
